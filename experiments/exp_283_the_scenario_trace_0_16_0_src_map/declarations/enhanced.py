"""An enhanced index from a saved alpha: benchmark plus a slice of the published factor weights.

The factor run (scenario ④) published its allocation as the dataset `sample-factor-weights`,
one row per name per decision, `weight` signed. This strategy reads it like any other dataset
and tilts an equal-weight benchmark by ACTIVE times that alpha, floored at zero: a long-only
index with a factor lean, on the sample venue.
