"""Bake the cubes a `--jobs` batch of the given runs would bake, into OUT, and list what is on disk.

`exp_238/probe_cubes.py` on the 0.16.0 tree (`run/batch.py`, `workspace/registry.py`). The batch
removes its directory when it returns, so the driver trace never shows the files; this runs
`_bake_for_batch` the way `batch_cubes` does and prints each file with its size and shape:

    uv run python experiments/exp_280_the_scenario_trace_0_16_0/probe_cubes.py \
