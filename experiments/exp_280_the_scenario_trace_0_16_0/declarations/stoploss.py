"""A stop-loss strategy: what it remembers between sessions lives in `self.memory`.

The first session buys every name with a close, equal weight, and writes each name's entry
close into memory. Every session after that compares the newest close with the remembered
entry; a name that fell more than STOP is dropped for the rest of the run and its stop is
recorded, with the session it fired on. Memory is strict JSON -- floats and strings -- restored
before every `decide` and snapshotted after, so a replay of the run sees the same stops.
