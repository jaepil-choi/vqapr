"""Digest every run record the showcases leave, normalised so it can be compared across a refactor.

The two-clocks campaign changes the spine twice (Stages 2 and 4 of
`docs/refactoring/2026-09-09-the-two-clocks-campaign.md`). What must not change while it does is
**what a run records**, and the only way to say that with evidence is to hold a baseline beside the
tree and compare.

**Two things vary between two identical runs and neither is the record's content.** Measured on
`show_005_enhanced_index` at `redesign/two-clocks`, running the pipeline twice: every parquet table
and every `run.json` was byte-identical, and `strategy.json` differed in exactly

    .timing.*            wall clock. Not reproducible and not meant to be
    .component.path      an absolute path into the project directory

So the digest drops `timing` wherever it appears and rewrites the repository root out of every
string. Everything else is compared.

**Tables are hashed logically, not byte for byte.** A parquet writer that changes its compression
or its metadata would otherwise read as a data change and bury the real one. The digest reads each
table, renders its rows in a stable order, and hashes that -- so a format change is invisible and a
row change is not. Schema and row count are kept beside the hash so a mismatch is readable without
opening the file.

Usage::

    uv run python scripts/showcase_record_digest.py                  # print the digest
    uv run python scripts/showcase_record_digest.py --write PATH     # save it
    uv run python scripts/showcase_record_digest.py --check PATH     # compare against a baseline

`--check` exits non-zero and names every difference. Run the showcases first; this script only
reads what they left. `--showcases PATH` digests another checkout's `showcases/` directory -- a
worktree compared against develop's own outputs.

Sixty-four-hex digests are masked everywhere (one-loop campaign, 2026-09-10): a run identity folds
the sources' paths, so the same declaration run from two checkouts writes two `run_id`s into
otherwise identical rows, and a baseline recorded in one checkout could never match the other.
What a component's fingerprint or a run's identity computes is pinned by its own tests; what this
digest pins is everything else the run wrote.
