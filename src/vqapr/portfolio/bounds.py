"""The box a strategy builds inside: pure functions over instrument names and weights.

Design §7.1 (`docs/design/two-clocks-and-the-wiring-table.md`): **a constraint is not an extension
point.** Construction is best effort, best effort is discretion, and discretion is the strategy's,
so there is nothing for the framework to guarantee about it. What the framework ships is a kit --
functions a callback calls before `Rebalance`, each returning the lower and upper weight bound for
every name it was given:

    lo, hi = intersect(no_short(names), single_name_cap(names, benchmark, cap))
    return Rebalance(**optimize(desired=..., lower=lo, upper=hi, ...))

Everything here is a pure function of its arguments. A rule that needs data -- the cap needs the
benchmark's weight per name -- is handed it by the strategy, which subscribes to that dataset
itself, so the dependency is visible on the strategy where it belongs rather than hidden inside a
component's own `inputs()`. Observing whether the committed book actually respected a limit is a
different question with a different clock, and a Compliance rule answers it (design §7.2).

Every bound returned lands on the canonical grid `optimize` enforces, rounded inward
(`docs/issues/092`): a box built here is a box the optimiser accepts.

Record `208`.
