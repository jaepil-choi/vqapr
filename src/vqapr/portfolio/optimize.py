"""Constrained allocation solved exactly, with no solver package.

Without a cost term, a turnover penalty or an exposure mapping, the problem in Architecture 5.3
collapses to a box projection onto a budget hyperplane::

    minimise  || w - desired ||^2
    subject to  sum(w) + c = 1,  l <= w <= u,  c in cash_range,  w_j = current_j for j frozen

Its solution is parameterised by a single multiplier: ``w_i = clip(desired_i - lam, l_i, u_i)``.
The clipped sum is piecewise affine in ``lam`` with breakpoints at ``desired_i - l_i`` and
``desired_i - u_i``, so sorting those ``2n`` values locates the bracketing segment and the
multiplier is solved **exactly in rational arithmetic**. There is no iteration, so there is no
precision budget to declare and no tolerance to tune.

Three rules keep the result exact rather than approximately exact:

* **Frozen names are never quantized.** They are emitted verbatim from ``current`` so frozen
  invariance holds bit for bit. Precision is constrained at the entrance instead: a frozen input
  finer than the canonical grid is refused.
* **Cash is the only residual sink.** Adding a rounding residual to an instrument could push it
  past a bound that the caller was promised would hold.
* **Every returned weight lands on the canonical grid**, so a later ``sum(w) + cash == 1`` check
  carries few enough significant digits to be exact in the caller's own context. The associativity
  problem does not shrink, it disappears.
