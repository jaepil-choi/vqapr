"""Writing one run's record: its rows into its own directory, its facts last.

The writer half. `RunRecordWriter` claims a run id with a lock, takes chunks of rows into an
Arrow buffer, seals them as one parquet file per table when the run ends, and writes the record
that marks it complete. `write_run_record` writes the one file every strategy of a run shares.

Imports `reader.py`, and is imported by nothing in this package: a writer reads the lock to
learn whether somebody else holds this id, and reads `run.json` to learn whether the run already
on disk describes a different configuration.

        A second run under an existing id would interleave its rows with the first run's, and the
        result would be a record that is not either run. Refusing here is the same rule
        materialization applies to a published output: one producer, one artifact.

        `replace` is the deliberate override, and it is off by default for a measured reason: in a
        five-process factor loop a repeated run to the same id is far more often a retry than an
        intended overwrite, and an accidental clobber is unrecoverable while a refusal costs one
        flag. Replacing removes the old directory outright rather than merging into it, because a
        merge is exactly the interleaved record this refuses to produce.

        What counts as "already exists" is the RECORD, not the directory. A run killed partway
        leaves its rows and no `record.json`, and every reader here already calls that not-a-run:
        `run_ids` omits it, `read_record` refuses it. Refusing on the directory made the writer
        stricter than its own readers, so the obvious retry of a crashed run was blocked and the
        operator was routed to `--force` -- to delete a dead partial that no reader would ever
        have returned. A retry now simply overwrites it, which is what a retry means.

        `--force` is about a DEAD claim, never a live one. That distinction is the whole design,
        and getting it wrong is not a race: two terminals reproduce it deterministically. Run A
        holds an id and is appending; the operator forces the same id; B removes A's directory and
        creates its own; A's next append re-resolves the path -- `append` opens and closes per
        chunk and holds nothing -- and writes into B's. Both finish into one `record.json`, and
        `run_ids` then lists one complete run whose tables hold two runs' rows. Measured directly:
        rows came back `['B1', 'A2']`.

        So liveness is what is checked, using the lock this repository already uses for the
        workspace (`workspace.py:987`): `O_CREAT | O_EXCL` succeeds for exactly one process on
        Windows and POSIX alike, the holder's pid rides inside it, and a lock older than
        `LOCK_STALE_AFTER` belongs to a run that died. A live id is refused even under `--force`; a
        stale one is reclaimed.

        That also dissolves the cost the previous design accepted. A crashed run's lock is stale,
        so an ordinary retry reclaims its id with no flag at all -- the operator is not charged for
        someone else's crash.
