"""The account aggregate: the ledger it appends to, the snapshot folded from it, the marks that
value it, and the `Account` that is the only authority over all three.

Two things reach an account, by two doors. An entry changes the book -- a fill today; a dividend,
coupon, interest or funding payment once accrual exists -- and is appended with `Account.append`. A
mark values the book and changes nothing in it, and is recorded with `Account.mark`. A mark at an
instant without a fill appends no entry and does not move `account_version`: the version means
the account changed.

**One shape, an origin tag.** A fill, a dividend, a split and a subscription all move cash and
quantities in some combination of the same two cells, so a `LedgerEntry` is those two deltas plus
its `origin` and that origin's `detail`. The account checks what an account knows -- the state it
holds (version order), that the result is a valid account (cash never negative; no negative
position in a long-only book), that an entry is appended once -- and nothing else. Whether a fill's
cash is its price times its quantity less its cost is checked by whoever made the fill, and turning
a fill into entries is `domain/fill.py`'s, so this module never learns what its producers are.

**Not fill-only.** Encoding a dividend as a zero-quantity buy keeps the numbers right and corrupts
every count that reads fills as fills; the run's fill table is written from fill-origin entries
alone.
