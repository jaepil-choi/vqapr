"""The wiring table: which clock each role is called on, what it is handed, who receives its answer.

Design §4 (`docs/design/two-clocks-and-the-wiring-table.md`): **this table is the architecture.**
Every role the framework calls back is one row of it, and the two things that differ between
roles -- when it is called, and who receives its answer -- are decided here and nowhere else
(§4.1). The base class stays thin (§4.2: a role subscribes, remembers, and has one callback); the
clock and the receiver are not on the base, they are on this row.

**The table is the framework's and it is closed.** Adding a role means adding a row, because a
row decides a clock and a receiver, and those are the framework's decisions (§4). The test that
guards this (`tests/domain/test_the_wiring_table.py`) refuses a `Role` without a row and a row
that disagrees with the authoring class that implements it.

**Parts and tools** (§4.3): the one criterion is whether a role declares its own clock. A part
does -- one per run: `DataModel`, `StrategyModel`. A tool attaches to somebody else's clock:
`Exchange`, `Compliance`, `Accrual`. A part is a tool plus a clock, and the types say so
(`component.base.Part`, `component.base.Tool`).

Data rather than types (design §10.2, decided at M13, record `213`): a row is read by tests, by
the loop's docstrings and by a reader of the design; it is compared, listed and counted, which a
table does and a class hierarchy makes you reconstruct. The types carry the one structural fact
that code has to enforce -- part or tool -- and point back here for the rest.

Layer 0: this imports nothing and everything above may read it.
