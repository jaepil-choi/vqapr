"""What a venue will do with one instrument, and the read-only view order planning consumes.

``TradeRule`` is the venue's whole authority over one instrument: the unit it trades in, how far
its position may move, and what each side costs. ``ExchangeRulesView`` is the closed projection of
those rules handed to ``plan_orders``, so the intended-to-requested conversion rounds and charges
with the venue's own numbers instead of guessing them.

**Quantity and cost are one rule, not two.** They were split because canon separated things by how
fast they change -- units never, rates by period -- but nothing ever declared a period-dependent
rate, and the machinery that supported it was dead. With rates flat, both halves answer the same
question at the same rate of change: *what will this venue do with this instrument?* Minimum size,
lot unit and fractional divisibility are as much "may this trade" facts as a rate is a "what does
it cost" fact, and a venue that lists an instrument always knows both.

Two declarations still meet here, and those are genuinely different (canon 2.8):

    what an instrument *is*      ``Instrument``  -- category, venue-independent
    what this venue does with it ``TradeRule``   -- unit, access, cost

The join is by ``instrument_id``. ``TradeTerms`` declares one rule per *category* and expands it,
because a venue rarely has three thousand distinct rules -- but the resolved form stays
per-instrument, because some venues genuinely do (HKEX board lots differ by instrument).

`Side` lives here because a listing permits sides and charges per side; orders and fills read it
from here.

        without order planning or any venue learning what a multiplier is.

        **Falls back to the base conversion only when no roster reached this view, and only
        because no shipped category overrides it.** All four -- stock, etf, index, factor -- use
        `base_notional` unchanged, so for every category that exists today the fallback and the
        declared answer are the same number. Refusing here would stop a run to compute a value it
        would have computed identically.

        That is a statement about today, and it has an expiry. The first category that overrides
        this pair -- a future with a contract multiplier is the obvious one -- makes the fallback
        wrong by exactly that multiplier, silently, on the order-sizing path. `_sizing_is_uniform`
        below is what makes that moment loud instead: it fails the moment an override appears, so
        this branch cannot outlive the assumption it rests on.

        Charging is different and refuses immediately, because a category's RATE differs today:
        KRX exempts an ETF from the sale tax a share pays. That is the defect issue 007 found, and
        it is closed by `kind` raising rather than returning `None`.
