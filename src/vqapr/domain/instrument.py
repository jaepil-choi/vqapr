"""Venue-independent instrument identity.

Canon 2.8 splits an instrument's facts along two axes: does it change over time, and does it
change with the venue. ``kind`` answers no to both -- a stock does not become an ETF, and it is a
stock on every venue -- so it lives here in ``domain`` and not in ``exchange``. Quantity units and
permitted sides answer yes to the venue axis and belong to ``ListingRule``; tradability and price
answer yes to the time axis and belong to the execution table.

This module is the reason a cost band can name a *kind* instead of an instrument id. KRX exempts
ETFs from the sale tax stocks pay, and that exemption is a rule about a category, not about a list
of tickers -- see ``vqapr.domain.cost``.

The four categories are the ones ``UC-ACADEMIC-001`` names:

    Stock                        a common share
    ETF                          an exchange-traded fund, taxed differently on some venues
    tracking-only Index          an index level, referenced rather than held
    synthetic-unit-price Factor  a factor held against a synthetic unit price

**Tradability is not here, deliberately.** Canon 6.2: *"거래 가능 여부를 넣지 않는 이유 --
``permitted_sides``가 이미 표현한다. 같은 사실을 두 곳에 두지 않는다"*. Whether an instrument can
be traded is a venue judgement, and the same instrument gets different answers on different venues:
a factor is tradable on an academic venue and not listed at all on KRX. A venue says so by
declaring a ``ListingRule`` whose access is ``NONE``, or by not listing it.

Nor is a category "synthetic" or "real". That axis exists -- an ETF's NAV is computed from a
basket, a KTB futures settlement price is computed from a deliverable basket, an index level is
computed from constituents -- but it describes **how a price is formed**, not whether the thing can
be filled. A KTB future is entirely tradable and its reference price is entirely synthetic. The
package therefore never branches on it.

Adding an instrument category
-----------------------------
``kind`` is a closed discriminator and each category is its own class, so a new category is
additive: add the enum member, add the class, register it below. Nothing that already exists is
edited. Categories with their own facts are exactly where those facts belong:

    FUTURE   expiry, contract multiplier, settlement currency
    BOND     maturity, coupon, accrual convention

``notional`` and ``quantity_for`` are the inverse pair every money-to-quantity conversion in the
package routes through, so a category whose contract size is not one share overrides two methods
here rather than editing order planning and each venue. They are declared on the base precisely so
that the override site exists before it is needed.

**Not implemented, and therefore not claimed**

- Margin and collateral, mark-to-market settlement, expiry rollover, and any cash flow that is not
  a fill. Whether a position consumes its full notional or a margin deposit is an *account* fact
  (canon 2.8: negative cash is decided by the account type), so a leveraged category needs an
  account mode alongside the class added here. Neither exists yet.
- **A Factor's synthetic unit price is not synthesised here.** The category says a factor is held
  against a unit price; producing that series -- a cumulative return index, however normalised --
  is the user's registration, published through the execution table like any other price. The
  package does not invent it, because the normalisation is a research decision.

# A category answers no to both axes canon 2.8 splits an instrument's facts along -- a stock does
# not become an ETF, and it is a stock on every venue -- so it belongs to the project rather than to
# any venue. A venue reading that fact is right; a venue *declaring* it is the defect issue 008
# names.
#
# **The roster is a registered table, not a component.** A component is a thing Flow CALLS, which is
# what `conformance`'s contract table encodes; a roster is a thing a run READS. Forcing it into
# a `Role` would buy the loader machinery at the price of an entry in that table whose answer
# is nothing.
#
# **One file per kind.** A parquet file carries exactly one schema, so a single file cannot hold
# categories whose attributes differ. Keying the files by kind in the declaration keeps each schema
# exact -- no nullable columns standing in for "not applicable" -- and makes adding an
# attribute-bearing category additive: a new key and a new file, with every existing file unchanged.
#
# **The `kind` column is duplicated into each file on purpose.** The declaration already states it
# via the key, so the column is redundant; carrying it anyway lets registration check the two
# against each other, which catches a file pointed at the wrong key. Redundancy bought for a check.
#
# **Validation runs twice, and registration trusts nothing.** The exporter validates while building,
# because a typed constructor refusing a bad value at creation is the cheapest place to catch it.
# Registration validates again, because a hand-written parquet is an equally legitimate input and
# must get the identical treatment. Producing a clean file is the user's responsibility; refusing a
# dirty one is the framework's -- the same split `available_at` already states.
