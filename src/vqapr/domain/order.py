"""Orders, and the one place a weight becomes a quantity.

`plan_orders` converts a complete target into the deltas that reach it at execution-time prices.
The strategy declared its target one evaluation earlier against prices that have since moved, so
the conversion belongs here, where the execution price and NAV are both known. It is a function,
not a protocol: there is one implementation and the layer is closed.

Sells come first. Buys are funded from cash and the rounded sale proceeds -- never from a sale the
venue will refuse -- and when cash runs short they are clipped largest delta first, the instrument
id breaking a tie, so the shortfall lands on the position that misses its target by least. What a
buy can afford, costs included, is solved rather than searched.

    notional is ``available / (1 + rate)``. The conversion back to a quantity goes through the

    multiplier -- keeps working.

    cash stays in the account, which is what the caller does with a zero. The refusal this
    replaces ended the run *and* asserted a cause ("the venue's notional or cost is not monotone")
