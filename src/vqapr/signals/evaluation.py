"""Did the signal predict anything — measured on what a run actually stored.

These are tools for judging a strategy, not part of one. Nothing here decides a weight, and nothing
here manufactures a return: every number is computed from values a run already recorded, which is
what keeps the execution spine the sole source of performance.

The information coefficient is the cross-sectional correlation between a signal and the return that
followed it. Its rank form uses the ordering instead of the values, which is what a researcher
usually wants, because a single extreme name can otherwise carry the whole number.

The sums run in exact rationals so a perfect correlation is recognised as such rather than reported
as a rounded near-one; where the answer needs a square root, it carries the ambient ``Decimal``
context's precision like any other Decimal arithmetic. These functions take realised values as
arguments and never open a store, so a caller cannot accidentally measure against data the strategy
could not have seen.
