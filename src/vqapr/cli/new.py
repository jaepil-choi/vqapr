"""`vqapr new <kind> [<id>]` — emit a component that runs, or a template spec.

Two modes:

- `vqapr new datamodel|strategy <id> --dataset <d>` emits a component `.py` and its registrable
  declaration `.yaml`. Both files are complete: `vqapr new` then `vqapr register` is the whole
  path from nothing to a registered component.

- `vqapr new dataset|run --out <path>` emits a YAML template with
  every required key, inline comments explaining each one, and placeholder values that need
  replacing. An agent that reads this file knows exactly what `vqapr register` or `vqapr run`
  expects, without opening documentation or guessing field names.

## Every declaration kind a run needs has a template

`register` understands four sections, and a run needs three of them: a dataset (the venue table a
run fills against is a dataset with an `execution:` role), an exchange and the run itself. There is
no schedule artifact to register (record `148`, then `204`): the run declares its own `schedule` --
a trading-day filter and a within-day rule -- and its one model is called at every instant of it and
decides for itself; the book is valued at every instant of the market clock, and the declared
Compliance rules observe it right after.
