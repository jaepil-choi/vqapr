"""`vqapr check <run-id>` — prove a registered run is ready without starting it or touching a file.

Two properties make this verb worth having, and both are about what it does NOT do.

**It collects.** `freeze` raises on the first thing it finds, which is right for a
gate standing in front of a run: the first refusal is the reason the run must not start, and
proving the rest costs time the caller did not ask for. But it makes preparing a declaration a
sequence of round trips -- fix the dataset, re-run, learn the schedule is missing, re-run, learn the
account holds an unlisted name. `check` runs the same judgments and reports every INDEPENDENT one
together, so an agent repairing its own setup receives the whole list.

**It does not mutate.** No file under `.vqapr/` is created, moved or rewritten. That is asserted
byte-for-byte in the tests rather than claimed here, and the claim stops exactly there: `check`
imports user code, because `weights` and `records` are Python and there is no way to judge a
component without loading it. What it guarantees is that *vqapr* writes nothing.

**Dependent checks are reported, not silently dropped.** Some judgments cannot run until an
earlier one passes -- there is no point resolving execution targets for a run the workspace does
not hold. Those are reported as `blocked`, naming what blocked them, so the reader can tell
"this passed" from "this never ran" from "this failed".

**A registered run since record `139`.** The argument is a run id; the phases are the workspace,
the run's registration, the judgments, and preflight. There is no file to check: the
materialization spec retired with record `148` (a datamodel is a `runs:` entry), and a path given
here is refused by name.
