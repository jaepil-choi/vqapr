"""`vqapr run <run-id>` — freeze a registered run, preflight it, and execute the model it names.

A run is a registered declaration since record `139` (`runs:` in a declaration document, design
§4.1): the reusable unit is a name in the workspace, not a file. This verb looks the run up,
makes the same judgments `vqapr check` makes, freezes it, and runs its one model in its own flow
with its own account and its own record. A datamodel run (record `148`) is the same verb: its
model writes a dataset instead of tables.

**One model per run** (2026-09-09, `docs/design/two-clocks-and-the-wiring-table.md` §2.3), so
there is no member to select and `--strategy` is gone. Several models means several runs.
