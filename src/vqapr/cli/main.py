"""`vqapr` entrypoint.

The CLI is a thin layer on purpose. It parses arguments, calls the public facade, and renders one
JSON envelope.

**Usage is the CLI's to state; remedy is the skill's.** The two are different authorities and the
split is what keeps them from competing. `--help` must answer "what is this command and what does
it take" without the reader opening a document, because a reader who has to guess a verb's meaning
has already lost the time the envelope was designed to save. What the CLI still does not do is
explain *how to recover*: the package decides deterministically and the agent skill does the
talking (PRD §2.6), so a remedy invented here would be a second, unversioned authority.
