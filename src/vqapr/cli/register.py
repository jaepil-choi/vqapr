"""`vqapr register <declaration.yaml>` — validate everything declared, then persist it.

**One verb, one file.** A workspace holds two kinds of thing: code the user wrote (a Strategy, a
DataModel, a Compliance rule, a venue) and facts about the world that code needs (where the data is,
what its columns mean, when decisions happen, at what price they fill). Both are registrations —
both are refused unless they check out, and both live in the same workspace — so both enter here.

`check` is not a separate command. Every path through this file validates before it writes, so a
registration that succeeds is one the framework can use, and nothing lands that cannot be run.

## Why a file and not flags

A component cannot be registered from argv alone without lying about what registration needs. A
DataModel needs the dataset it reads; a Strategy needs its cadence; a dataset needs its
`available_at` column, its logical key, and the field map that gives its columns framework names.
None of that fits a flag, and a command that accepted the component without them would register
something no run could use — the exact "registered but unusable" state this package refuses.

So the declaration is the unit. `vqapr new` emits one beside the component it scaffolds, and
`register` refuses a component that does not bring one.

## What is validated, not merely recorded

- **datasets** — every declared column exists, `available_at` is timezone-aware, and the logical
  key is scanned in full for nulls and duplicates. A dataset whose `(available_at, instrument)`
  repeats is refused with the offending groups as evidence, because a duplicated key silently
  changes what a lookback window contains.
- **execution datasets** — a dataset with an `execution:` role gets the same schema check, plus
  a boolean tradable flag and at least one numeric price a run could bind.
- **components** — loaded, constructed, and put through `conformance()`: every contract method
  Flow calls must exist and accept the positional call it makes.
- **runs** — every id a run names must already be registered, and its sessions' dataset too.

Sections are applied in dependency order, not file order, so a valid document cannot fail because
of how the user happened to type it.
