"""`vqapr show run|strategy|model|dataset <id>` — answer questions from what was frozen.

Reads the record. Does not recompute, and could not: the process that ran the simulation is gone,
and re-running it to answer a question about it would be a different run with a different answer.

**Two records since record `139`** (design §4.2). `show run <run-id>` reads `run.json`: the
configuration every strategy shared -- and, for a materialization or a run recorded before `139`,
the `record.json` those still write. `show strategy <run-id>/<id>@<fp8>` reads one strategy's
`strategy.json`, and `--table` reads that strategy's rows back.

Both sides of each record are built from one field set (`record_fields`), so the reply and the
file cannot diverge: a field named there without a builder is an error at the writer.
