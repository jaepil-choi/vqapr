"""Turn a user-authored declaration document into registered workspace declarations.

**Moved out of `cli/register.py` by record `112`.** That module was 1,093 lines and held all of it:
reading a YAML mapping, validating its keys, resolving relative paths, parsing agendas and sessions,
walking a `.py` with `ast` to find the sole subclass, and registering the result. The CLI was not a
surface over this logic; it *was* this logic.

`docs/vqapr-architecture.md` §10.2 defines the CLI as a product surface rather than a layer, and a
surface that owns rules costs twice. The rules cannot be tested without driving argparse, and they
cannot be reached from another entry point -- so a second entry point grows its own copy and the two
diverge. `docs/issues/archive/012` is exactly that: `check` refused a spec `run` completed, because
each verb decided for itself.

`cli/register.py` keeps argparse wiring, one call into this module, and envelope rendering.
