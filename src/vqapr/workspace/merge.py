"""Folding one registration into the workspace state, without a workspace.

Three of the four merges never touched `self`: they take a `_State`, decide whether the incoming
declaration is new, conflicting or identical, and return the next `_State` with a flag. They were
methods only because they were written inside the class that calls them, and `_merge_dataset` alone
is 122 lines of that -- the largest single thing `Workspace` held.

`_merge_run` and `_require_run_references` stay on the class: they read `self._runs` and the other
registries to check the references a run names, so they are genuinely about a workspace rather than
about a state.

Pure functions of `(_State, declaration) -> (_State, bool)`, which is what makes them testable with
a constructed state and unable to read anything the caller did not hand them.
