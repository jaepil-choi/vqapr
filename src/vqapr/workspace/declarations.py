"""The workspace document and the declaration document, as pydantic models.

One model per YAML section: the shape a section has on disk (`workspace.yaml`) and in a
declaration an author registers. Key sets, scalar types, enums, dates and times are the model's
field declarations; pydantic checks them, and `declarations.refusals_from` turns what it finds
into this package's refusals. Nothing here opens a file, resolves a path or looks another
section up -- a model is a shape, and the cross-reference checks stay with the workspace.

Record `145` (deletion campaign Step 4): these models replaced the hand-written `_decode` /
`_encode` / `_detach_*` of the former `workspace_codec.py` and the `_require_keys` / `_mapping` /
`_enum` family in `declarations.py`, one section at a time, and the codec file was deleted. The
legacy document shapes a released workspace can still carry (an old fill schema, the agenda-keyed
strategy config, the two retired sections) are all declared in this one file, so a later release
that retires one discards a region rather than hunting for it. Where the stored shape and the domain
dataclass coincide, `to_domain` is a one-liner; where they differ (a dataset's measured span, an
schedule's events, a run's initial account) the model is the one place the mapping is written.

    `field_types`. Measured: `aggregated`, `span`, `source_digest`, `execution_prices` (record

    `field_types` was a measurement from `docs/issues/archive/049` until 2026-09-08 and is a
    declaration since (`docs/issues/archive/088`); an entry written under the old shape carries the
