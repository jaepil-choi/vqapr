POSIX ``rename`` is unconditional, so a reader holding the old inode is simply left holding it and
the swap succeeds. Windows refuses instead: ``os.replace`` onto a path another process currently
has open fails with ``WinError 5``, and the reader's own ``open`` can fail with a sharing
violation for the moment the swap takes. Both surface as ``OSError``.

The workspace lock does not cover this. It serialises *writers* against each other, which is what
stops a lost update -- but a **reader** takes no lock, deliberately: a run reads the workspace on
every callback, and serialising that behind every registration would be a far worse trade. So a
writer can hold the lock, be the only writer, and still be refused by a reader that arrived
between its own read and its write.

Measured on this repository before the retry: 1 run in 10 with eight processes registering at
once, on both the read and the write side. The condition is a swap that completes in microseconds,
so outlasting it is the proportionate fix -- and a real permission problem still fails, because it
outlasts the retries.

    reference is refused where the author can still see which item it was.

    write: the merges are replayed against the state read under the lock, so a registration
    that landed from another process in the meantime is seen and, if it conflicts, refused --
