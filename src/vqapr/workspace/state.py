Its own module because three others need it and none of them should have to import the class that
happens to hold one: `merge.py` folds a declaration into a state, `references.py` searches one, and
`registry.py` reads and writes them. A `_State` in `registry.py` would make both of the first two
import the `Workspace` module to name their own argument type.
