"""What still points at a declaration, and the refusal that names it.

A registration may not be withdrawn while something else names it, so `remove` asks this before it
writes -- and asks it of the state it already holds, inside the lock, so the check and the write
see one snapshot. The docstring below says what asking twice cost.

Free functions for the same reason as `merge.py`: none of the three read `self`. They take the
state to search, which is what makes "check under the lock" expressible at all.
