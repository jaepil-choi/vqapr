"""One refusal, one failure, for everything the project layer declines.

`_workspace_error` and its twenty-six callers lived in one file until record `194`, and a test
pinned them there: an attempt to move it measured **37 refusal codes removed from the baseline**
with a green suite and a clean lint, because the inventory that resolves a forwarded `code`
argument could only follow a helper defined in the same file.

Record `171` rebuilt that inventory package-wide -- its `_SourceIndex` is *"built once over every
module under `src/vqapr`"*, and says in as many words that the per-file version *"dropped codes
from the baseline"* whenever a module was split. The constraint expired with it, and the campaign
measured that before moving anything: the constructor moved to a probe module, its callers stayed,
and the gate reported gained 0 / lost 0 with all 22 literal codes still resolved
(`docs/refactoring/2026-09-08-the-layering-campaign.md` section 5).

So it lives here, where `registry.py`, `merge.py` and `references.py` can all reach it without one
of them owning the other.
