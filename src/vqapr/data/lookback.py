    is 313 instants, and a name that stopped publishing simply contributes fewer values inside
    that window rather than reaching further back than everyone else. The batch's calendar span
    is bounded by the table, not by its sparsest name -- which is what makes a cross-section built
    from it safe. `docs/issues/033` measured the other meaning: 1,637 names, `rows=313`, and a
    batch spanning 1,865 sessions because a name delisted in 2019 still got its own last 313.

    **That other meaning still exists, under its own name.** `InstantsLookback(n)` is each name's
    own last n reported instants, per field, and it belongs to `grain: rows` -- the vendor's long
    table, where no row is shared between names. Registration and the read path refuse each on
    the other grain, so the same number cannot silently mean two things (§7-1, §7-3).

    measured the version that counted rows and reached one instant's first n rows. This was
    `RowsLookback`'s meaning until the lookback types followed the grain (design §2.4); it is the
