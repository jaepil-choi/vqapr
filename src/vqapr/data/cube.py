"""A cube: one dataset's numeric fields over every instrument, as files a batch memory-maps.

Record `236` (`docs/issues/098`). A `--jobs` batch of 671 runs read one 430 MB parquet 671
times, each worker scanning it into a panel of its own, and twelve of those panels would not fit
in 15.7 GB beside twelve interpreters. The data itself is small -- 309 names over seven years of
one field is 7 MB -- so what cost was the copies, and the scans that made them.

A cube is the panel a batch would build if it declared **every** instrument the source holds:
per numeric field one `(instants x instruments)` float64 matrix, `NaN` where the source had no
value, laid out exactly as `Panel.from_table` lays a field out (`panel.placement`), written as a
`.npy` beside an `instants.npy`, an `instruments.json` and a `present.npy` that says where a
source row existed at all. The driver bakes it once when the batch starts (`orchestration.
batch_cubes`) and removes it when the batch ends; a worker memory-maps the files and takes its
panel as a slice -- a view when the run declared the whole universe, a gather otherwise. The OS
page cache then holds the bytes once per machine for every worker that maps them
(`experiments/exp_236_the_panel_memory`: four processes, one 0.40 GB file, 0.48 GB of memory
and 0.00 private per process; `np.load` costs 1.58 GB), and pages nobody touches are never read.

A cube never persists beyond its batch (owner decision 2026-09-10): a single run scans as it
always did, and no file accumulates. A dataset whose declared field is not numeric, whose
registration is unverified, or whose grain is `rows` has no cube; its worker takes the scan path
and refuses what it must, by name, as before.
