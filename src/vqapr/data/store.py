    """What one declared requirement returned, and the record of how it was read.

    This is the only shape a Model ever receives data in, and until 2026-08-30 it was not
    importable from `vqapr.public` and had no docstring -- so an author could read its name in
    `observations()`'s signature and had no way to learn what it holds without opening installed
    source. One journey answered the questions below by registering a throwaway DataModel that
    reported `sorted(rows[0].keys())`, which is a full register-materialize-show cycle spent on one
    type's field names (`docs/issues/031`).

    **`rows` is a flat tuple of dicts, one per (instant, instrument) observation.** Every row
    carries:

    * `available_at` -- a timezone-aware `datetime`, the row's OWN point-in-time stamp rather than
      the window's evaluation time. Rows do not share one instant, so this is what a cross-section
      is built on.
    * `instrument` -- the instrument id, as a string. **Absent** on a dataset registered with no
      `instrument_field`: those rows are not keyed by instrument, the declared instrument list is
      not applied to them, and there is no name to put here (`docs/issues/038`).
    * the field the requirement named, under its own id -- a requirement names one field and a
      lookback, and nothing else (`docs/issues/049`). A value is `None` where the source has no
      value; an `InstantsLookback` also nulls it on rows outside that field's own last-N instants
      (see `InstantsLookback`).

    **A value arrives as the Python type of the field's declared `ColumnType`.** `DOUBLE` is
    `float`, `INTEGER` is `int`, `VARCHAR` is `str`, `BOOLEAN` is `bool`, `TIMESTAMP_TZ` is an
    aware `datetime`, `DATE` a `date`. Nothing here converts: the declaration was compared with
    the file once, at registration (`docs/issues/088`), and a DECIMAL column was refused there, so
    `Decimal` never arrives from a dataset. A model that wants exact arithmetic on a price crosses
    once, through `Decimal(str(value))` -- `Decimal(value)` on a float inherits the binary
    expansion -- which is what the scaffolds emit.

    **Ordering is guaranteed: ascending `available_at`, then the dataset's registered key fields.**
    It is pushed into SQL (`scan.observation_rows`) rather than applied afterwards, so it holds for
    every lookback and every instrument count, and `tests/data/test_observation_batch_shape.py`
    pins it. A dataset whose fields aggregate within an instant orders by `available_at` then
    `instrument` instead, because the key fields were consumed making the group and are not in
    what came out of it. Instruments therefore INTERLEAVE within an instant rather than being
    grouped by name:
    a per-instrument series is built by the reader, and a cross-section is `rows` filtered on one
    `available_at`. `ModelWindow.snapshot` returns the newest cross-section directly.

    `access` is the `AccessRecord` the framework stamps -- source digest, declared fields, the
    lookback, the bound it resolved, per-instrument non-null counts. It is provenance, not data,
    and a Model normally reads only `rows`.
