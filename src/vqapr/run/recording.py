"""Turning what a run produced into what its record holds.

Folded in from `flow/records.py` (one-shape Step 6, record `161`) and split back out of
`flow/record.py` by campaign M6 Step 3, which promoted the persistence machinery to
`vqapr.record`. This half stayed in the execution layer because it is the only part that reads
engine values: a `FrozenRun` and its layers, a `SimulationResult`, a `DataModelResult`. It turns
them into the record models `vqapr.record` defines and hands them to the writer.

That is also why the promotion could happen at all. `vqapr.record` imports nothing from `flow/`,
so a process that only reads records never imports the engine.

    carry. So a rule with `checked == 0` reports `ok: false` with a `cause` saying exactly that.
