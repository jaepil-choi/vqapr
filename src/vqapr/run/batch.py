A batch is refused unless its runs are independent -- none reads a dataset another writes, and no
two write the same one (`require_independent_batch`). Each worker process runs with one BLAS thread
(`one_blas_thread_for_workers`), and the datasets several members read are baked once into
memory-mapped cubes under the workspace, kept alive by a heartbeat and swept when stale
(`batch_cubes`). One run itself is `assemble.py`'s.

    holds one model now, so the unit is the run (`docs/design/two-clocks-and-the-wiring-table.md`
    §2.3). That is the more general unit as well -- two runs need share nothing, where two members
    shared a frozen layer -- and it is what a graph scheduler will hand this function later.

    strings and bools, because it crosses a `spawn` boundary. The

    `concurrent.futures` can pickle, which is why the strategy worker returns its outcome.
