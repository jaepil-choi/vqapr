"""Assemble and execute one run -- the one model it names -- from a frozen authority to results.

**This is where `vqapr.public.run` lives**, and record `111` is why it moved: a facade that
executes runs is not a facade. The run layer is frozen, and its model runs in its own
`strategy_loop` with its own `Account` and its own record directory (design §4.1, §7-4).

**One model per run** (2026-09-09, `docs/design/two-clocks-and-the-wiring-table.md` §2.3).
Record `139` had made it several so that a comparison would share one frozen layer; determinism
already gives that, so the sharing bought an optimisation and cost the ability to compare runs
made on different days. Parallelism moved with it: it used to be members inside a run and is now
independent runs, which is both more general and the unit the graph will schedule.

Running several runs at once (`--jobs`: workers, one BLAS thread each, the batch's shared cubes) is
`batch.py`.
