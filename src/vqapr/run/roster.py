`registered_roster` -- a PRIVATE name -- from the package's documented surface, which is the shape
that tells you a module has outgrown its role: the facade had a private consumer. It is
`registered_roster` here, and the CLI reaches it by that name.

The reading is deliberately fresh rather than frozen, and `docs/issues/archive/042` and
`docs/issues/archive/050` are why the guard around it is narrow. **The roster is read exactly once
per run**: what that read produced is carried in a `RegisteredRoster` and handed to `roster_report`,

when the record is written. See `registered_roster` for all of it.
