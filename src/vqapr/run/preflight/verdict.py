"""The one door from a registered `RunDefinition` to a `FrozenRun`: `preflight`.

`docs/design/2026-09-10-one-door-for-a-run.md`. A run declaration used to be read twice on its way
to running: once by the judgments (`judgments.py`, which answer every question independently so
`check` can report every defect at once) and once by the freeze (`preflight.py`, which resolves
names to values and refuses at the first). The two grew apart historically (records `087`, `168`
bolted them in sequence after `run` executed what `check` refused) and each derived the same facts
-- the schedule, the execution table and its horizon, the loaded components, the digests -- so one
`vqapr run` read the execution table five times (`experiments/exp_238`).

This module is the door both verbs and both doors (`cli` and `public.execute`) pass through, and
the `--jobs` worker too, which used to freeze without asking the judgments at all. What it returns
is a `RunVerdict`: the judgments' refusals, the judgments that could not answer, and either the
frozen run or what the freeze refused with -- kept as the exception it raised, because the two
verbs render a refusal differently (`check` as a failure entry with its stage, `run` as the
raised error with its own `retry_precondition`) and both must go on saying exactly what they said.

The facts are read once (`preflight.RunFacts`), and the judges and the freeze read them from
there.
