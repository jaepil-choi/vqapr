"""The judgments a run must pass, owned by neither verb that asks them.

These answer one question -- is this run worth starting? -- and both `check` and `run` need the
answer. They lived in `cli/check.py` because `check` was built on top of `run`'s spec vocabulary and
so the judgments landed in the verb that needed them first. That left `run` executing what `check`
would refuse: a real look-ahead ran to completion, wrote a permanent record, and appeared beside
legitimate runs with nothing marking it (`docs/issues/archive/015`).

Moving them here is what makes a single answer possible. The module sits below the CLI and imports
nothing from it, so both verbs can reach the same judgments without either importing the other.

**Judged on a `RunDefinition` since record `139`.** A run is a registered declaration rather than
a spec file, so the judgments read the definition the workspace holds -- and each of its strategies
is judged in turn, since one run now names several.

`judgments` returns its blocked list rather than filling a caller-supplied one. The out-parameter
it replaced was easy to forget -- and forgetting it means a run whose judgment could not ANSWER
reports as clean, which is the divergence this module exists to close, reproduced one layer down.

**No helper in this module catches on behalf of a judge** (`docs/issues/archive/077`). Five of them
did, and returned an empty result, which `judgments` cannot tell from "asked the question, found
nothing wrong" -- so `check` reported `passed: [..., "judgments"]` on a run whose look-ahead
judgment never ran, with `blocked` empty. Every judge here therefore lets its exception reach the
one wrapper below that owns the decision. The defect is then named twice, once as a blocked judgment
and once as preflight's own refusal, and that is deliberate: they are two different statements, one
saying the question could not be asked and the other saying what is wrong (owner decision,
2026-09-04).

The roster refusal lives here too (`require_declared_roster`, `absent_roster_failure`): a run that
declares a roster the workspace does not hold is one more judgment, raised by the freeze and
collected by the check. The code `roster.absent` was defined in both modules; one definition
survives.
