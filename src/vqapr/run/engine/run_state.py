    Read off the ledger entries the append made (record `211`): a fill entry's `detail` is the
    fill's own facts, and `version` is the account version the append produced.

    The five envelope fields are stamped here rather than by `InvocationRecorder`, because these
    rows are staged straight into the run-state chunks and never pass through a recorder. That is
    why they carried none of them while `vqapr.account` -- which does go through one -- carried all
    five (`docs/issues/archive/022`).

    `sequence` comes from the run when the caller supplies its sequencer (record `225`), so a
    fill takes its place in the run's one order beside every other recorded row; without one,
    a batch counts for itself.

    The parameter is optional because a caller with no event in hand -- the direct
    `AccountState` constructors in the test suite -- has nothing truthful to stamp, and inventing
    an `event_time` would be worse than omitting it. Production always supplies it.

    A refused fill is a market fact the run has to be able to show afterwards, so it is recorded
    with its reason rather than filtered out here.

    `kind` is the category the venue charged this fill under, and it is written here because this
    is the only place a later reader can recover it: the charge is a dictionary lookup at fill
    time and nothing downstream re-derives it. It was computed and then dropped, so every fill in
    a run reported no category even when the project had registered one -- which made
    the report's cost by kind collapse to a single "unknown" bucket, and made registering a
    roster produce no observable difference anywhere.

    `None` stays legal and means the run genuinely did not know: no roster reached the venue, or
    the roster described no category for this id. That is a fact worth recording rather than a
    reason to refuse, because a venue charging one flat rate does not need a category at all.

    The numbers go in as `Decimal` (record `264`). The ledger keeps its facts as text, and these
    rows used to copy that text, so the recorder saw strings and wrote untagged string columns:
    every reader got `"15900.0"` for a price while `nav` came back a `Decimal`, and three testbed
    agents' exporters broke on the difference. A `Decimal` is recorded as the same exact text, now
    tagged, so `read_table` restores it.
