"""One loop walks both kinds of run: a part on the schedule clock, tools on the market clock.

Design §3 leaves one difference between a strategy run and a datamodel run -- how many clocks it
walks -- and until record `227` that difference was two loop classes side by side (record `214`
put them in one file and stopped there: *"folding them into one class is a spine change"*). The
spine was that each loop stood on its own receiver, `RunStateRepository` for a strategy and
`RunOutput` for a datamodel. `RunLoop` does not stand on either. It walks the merged clocks and
hands each event to one of two things:

    the part      `Part.dispatch(event)`   the schedule clock: `StrategyModel.decide` or
                                                `DataModel.compute`, and what follows the answer
    the market    `MarketClock.at(event)`        the market clock: ACCRUE -> EXECUTE -> VALUATION ->
                                                COMPLIANCE -> close, the fold of record `226`

A part owns its receiver and its opening and closing (`start`, `finish`); a datamodel run simply
has no market clock. The walk -- start, the events sorted, one `handle` each, finish -- is
`RunLoop.run`, written once; until record `231` it sat in an abstract `EventLoop` whose only
subclass was this class (`docs/issues/097`). The two kinds are assembled by two functions,
`strategy_loop` and `datamodel_loop`: that is where a run's authorities are checked against each
other and its handlers built, and what they return is a `RunLoop` and nothing more specific.

The handlers are the other modules of this package, one per wiring-table row (design §4,
`domain/wiring.py`): on the schedule clock `callback.py` (decide) and `compute.py` (compute); on
the market clock, in the order §3.1 fixes, `accrual.py`, `execution.py`, `valuation.py` (the
framework's own step) and `compliance.py`. `context.py` is what a strategy run's handlers share;
`output.py` is the warehouse door a datamodel run writes through.
