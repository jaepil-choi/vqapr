"""The `call` a Model receives, and the typed observations it reads through it.

**One call surface for every Model role.** A DataModel, a StrategyModel and a Compliance rule
declare their reads the same way -- `inputs()`, keyed by an alias the author names -- and read
them the same way: `call.read(alias, field)` for a panel-grain alias, `call.rows(alias)` for a
rows-grain one. What a StrategyModel additionally receives is what its role needs: the committed
account and its own declared history. The difference between the roles is that list and nothing
else (`docs/issues/archive/036`).

**One alias is one scan.** An alias over several fields is several `DataRequirement`s
(`docs/issues/archive/049`: a requirement names one field), and `ModelWindow.declared` reads them in
one statement -- the store's window SQL ranks each field's own last N rows, so the rows come back
already joined on `(instant, instrument)` (record `136`).

**Every read goes through `ModelWindow`.** Nothing here holds a store handle. The window is
bounded to `available_at <= evaluation_time`, carries the consumer id the framework stamped, and
records an `AccessRecord` per read -- what lets the Flow state an intent's provenance and stamp a
datamodel row's `available_at`.

This module is the former `models/` package (`calls.py` + `contexts.py`) as one file; the
`Component` classes themselves live in `vqapr.component`.
