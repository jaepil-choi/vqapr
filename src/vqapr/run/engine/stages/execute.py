"""The EXECUTE stage of a market-clock instant: an accepted intent becomes orders, fills and a
committed account -- and, after VALUATION and COMPLIANCE have run on that account, the
evidence that closes the fill.

Record `147` moved the spine here verbatim from `StrategyEventLoop._execute_due`; record `207`
split it in two around the stages design §3.1 puts between them. `fill` is EXECUTE: the snapshot
the venue published at the instant, the instrument gate, `plan_orders`, the venue's `execute`,
`Account.prepare_fill` and the commit. `close` is the fill's epilogue, run once the book has
been valued (`ValuationHandler.mark_fill`) and judged (`monitor_at`): the feedback evidence and
its publication. The loop's `_handle_market` is the one place the order is written down."""
