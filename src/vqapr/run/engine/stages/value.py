"""The VALUATION stage: mark -> account.

Record `147`. What was `StrategyEventLoop._value_due`, `_dispatch_valuation` and their helpers,
moved verbatim. Which price marks each name is `domain/valuation.py::select_prices`, and the
multiplication is the account's own (`Account.mark`, record `276`). Record `209` moved
monitoring out to `observe.py`: it is the next stage of the market-clock instant, not this one."""
