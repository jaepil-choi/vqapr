"""COMPLIANCE: the fourth stage of a market-clock instant (design §3.1, §7.2).

Right after the book is marked, every Compliance rule the run declared observes it -- as of this
instant, reading what it subscribed to as of this instant -- and what each found is written to
`vqapr.monitoring` and published with the rule's memory. The observer changes nothing: no fill,
no mark, no decision, and the pending slot is left exactly as found.

Record `209`: this is the monitoring half of `valuation.py` (record `148`) on its own clock,
without the projection it used to redo first. A rule measures with its own parameters against
its own reads; the box the strategy built inside is not handed to it, because a watcher that
inherits the target of the thing it watches is grading itself.

The rule set's evaluation lives here too. A finding says what was measured; which rule measured it
is said once -- the rule declares its id, the loader checks it against the id it was registered
under, and this stage stamps it onto the finding. The stamped finding, its tolerance and verdict,
and the report they make are values in `component/compliance/report.py`: the run context carries
the report, and this stage imports the context.
