"""Templates emitted by `vqapr new`.

A template must **run as written**. A skeleton that raises on the first callback teaches nothing
and cannot be executed to see the shape of a result, so the emitted file is a complete working
Strategy with exactly one marked place to change.

The template deliberately knows nothing about listings, halts, or delistings. Tradability is an
execution-time fact the callback cannot observe (architecture §10, `docs/implementations/
013-halted-names-do-not-stop-a-rebalance.md`); eligibility falls out of whether the declared
lookback is present, and the venue publishes typed zero-dealt evidence for the rest.

Which lookback a kind's template may emit, and how much of it, is decided here too
(`lookback_declaration`): a template's guard has to mean something for the window it declares.

    dataset here would make the caller invent one to scaffold a rule that never opens it.

    `lookback_kind` selects which member of the lookback pair a DataModel declares. `rows` is the

    is the wrong member for every cross-sectional model and there was no way to ask for the other

    skill told authors to scaffold a day window with `--calendar-lookback`, and three of three
