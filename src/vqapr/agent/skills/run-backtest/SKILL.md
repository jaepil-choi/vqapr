name: run-backtest
description: Declares, checks, and executes a vqapr run: choosing sessions and decision times, binding a strategy to an exchange and compliance rules, proving readiness with `vqapr check`, then executing with `vqapr run`. Use when the user wants to run, execute, or backtest something already registered, asks why a run refuses to start, or asks what a long run is doing while it executes.

# Run a vqapr backtest

## Invoke the CLI through the active environment

Installing a console script into a virtual environment does not put it on the global shell PATH.
Use one launcher consistently:

- activated environment: `vqapr --help`
- uv-managed project: `uv run vqapr --help`

If bare `vqapr` is not found but `uv run vqapr` works, the package is installed; the environment
is simply not activated. Apply the same prefix to every command below.

## A run is configuration, and it is registered

Not a script and not a set of arguments. A run declares the universe, the period, the sessions it
fires on, the venue-local wall time it fires at, the venue, the execution dataset and the price it fills at, the initial
account, and the one model it runs — and it is registered like everything else, so a result can
always name the declaration that produced it.

**The strategy is called at every instant of the run's `schedule` and decides for itself whether
to act.** `every: 1d` with `at` is one decision a day; `every: 1M` the first trading day of each
month, and with `on: last` the last; `every: 12M` once a year (the count is free: `3M`, `2w`, `5d`; there is no year unit);
`every: 5m` with `from`/`to` every five minutes inside each day. The days come from the
execution dataset, never from a list. There is no valuation or monitoring time to declare: the
book is valued at every instant of the market clock, and the declared compliance rules observe it
right after.

**A run is one model.** Three factor models on one cadence are three runs with the same period,
venue and account; `vqapr run a b c --jobs 3` executes them side by side, and each writes its own
record. Two runs declaring the same inputs freeze identically, so the comparison is as sound as
one run would have made it.

## Workflow

```
Run progress:
- [ ] 1. vqapr new run --out runs.yaml
- [ ] 2. Fill it with registered ids
- [ ] 3. vqapr register runs.yaml
- [ ] 4. vqapr check <run-id>      <- writes nothing; fix everything it reports
- [ ] 5. vqapr run <run-id>
- [ ] 6. Confirm every strategy reached status: completed
```

### 1–2. Declare it

```bash
vqapr new run --out runs.yaml
```

The template carries every required key with its meaning. Fill it with **registered** ids: an
unregistered component, dataset or exchange is refused at step 3, by name.

The schedule clock is the `schedule:` block — `every` with `at`, or with `from`/`to` — expanded
over the trading days the execution dataset has rows for; `timezone` is the zone it is read in. See
[references/run-declaration.md](references/run-declaration.md) for what a run needs and what it
must not carry.

### 3. Register it

```bash
vqapr register runs.yaml
```

A run definition is the provenance of a result, so re-registering the same `run_id` with a changed
body is refused (`run.registered`, 409). Withdraw it with `vqapr rm run-definition <run-id>` and
register again; existing records stay readable.

### 4. Check it

```bash
vqapr check <run-id>
```

**Prove it before spending a run.** `check` writes nothing and reports every independent problem at
once, so a run with four defects costs one command rather than four round trips.

Read [references/check-before-run.md](references/check-before-run.md) before interpreting the
output — the envelope's `checked` list has four entries and there are eight judgments, and
expecting eight is the obvious mistake.

### 5. Run it

```bash
vqapr run <run-id> [<run-id> ...] [--jobs N] [--force]
```

Preflight once, freeze, execute. Several ids run several runs; `--jobs N` runs them in N
processes, one run per process, strategy and datamodel runs alike, and the batch envelope's
`jobs` says how many processes actually ran it. A batch in which one run reads the dataset
another run in it writes is refused whole before anything starts (`run.batch_dependent`, 400):
run the producer first, then the batch. Each run's entry under `runs` has the same shape a
single run's envelope has.

A batch reads each panel-grain dataset once: before the workers start it bakes every field the
runs declare into memory-mappable files under `.vqapr/cubes/<batch>/`, each worker maps them
instead of scanning the source, and the directory is removed when the batch returns. Memory per
worker is therefore at least its own period × lookback × instruments (once, shared, for a
whole-universe run) on top of about 130 MB of interpreter — **a floor, not an estimate**: one daily
strategy over 4,276 names and six and a half years, with few fills, peaked at 1.7–2.1 GB private
where that rule gives 0.25 GB. A strategy run also holds the rows it records until it ends — on
the order of half a kilobyte a fill for a 300-name daily book, spilled to disk past 256 MB — and
each decision's evidence. A worker of a batch starts with one BLAS thread (`OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1`
and its siblings, unless you set them), because a BLAS that may use every core reserves memory for
each one. Measure one run alone and size `--jobs` by that, not by core count.

A YAML path handed to `run` or `check` is refused by name — both take a registered id.

### 6. Confirm

`ok: true` with a `strategies` map where every entry carries `status: completed`, an `events`
count, an `account_version` and a `record` (`<strategy-id>@<fp8>`). For a datamodel run, a
`datamodels` map with `dataset_id`, `rows`, `sessions` and its record.

## When one run in a batch fails, the others still run

Each run is its own flow with its own account, so a refusal inside one is **that run's outcome,
not the batch's**. The envelope is `ok: false` with `stage: run.strategy_failed`, every run listed
with its status, and the failed run's refusal in its own block carrying its `stage`,
`component_id`, `failures` and `at`.

The completed records stand. Fix the failed strategy, register the file again, and
`vqapr run <run-id>` runs that one alone into a new record.

## While it is running

A record is written last, so a strategy with no record yet is not necessarily lost:
[references/watching-and-failures.md](references/watching-and-failures.md) covers `status: running`
versus `status: unfinished`, and how far the progress numbers can lag.

## After it finishes

- Reading the result is the **`analyze-result`** skill's job — start from `strategy_report` and
  `run_report`, not from the raw tables. (Named, not linked: a link into another skill's directory
  would pull its whole body in as a reference, and it is a skill in its own right.)
- Counting how many times a strategy was tweaked, and removing records:
  [references/records-and-tweaks.md](references/records-and-tweaks.md).
- Feeding one run's decisions into the next run as a dataset:
  [references/feeding-the-next-run.md](references/feeding-the-next-run.md).

## Stop condition

`vqapr check <run-id>` returns `ok: true`, then `vqapr run <run-id>` returns `ok: true` with every
strategy at `status: completed`. A run whose envelope is `ok: false` has not finished, even when
some strategies completed — say which ones did and which did not.

---

A refusal carries its own status, stage and cause, plus `fix`, `requirement`, `observed` and
`source` — read it rather than looking for it here. Status **423 or 503 means wait and retry the
same command unchanged**; **502 is a strategy's own code raising** (`cause.origin: "user"`,
`cause.where` names the line) — fix the component; **500 is a vqapr defect**: do not work around
it, report it with the envelope.
