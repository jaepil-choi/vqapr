Copies the strategy and the exchange as source files the user can read and edit, the synthetic
panel beside them, and one declaration document (`sample.yaml`) that registers the dataset, the
execution dataset, both components and the run. Nothing is registered here: the next step is
`vqapr register DIR/sample.yaml`, the same step every user declaration takes, so the sample shows
the real path rather than a shortcut through it.

# The vqapr sample journey

Everything here was written by `vqapr new sample`. The data is **synthetic** (see the note at the
end); the strategy and the venue are yours to read and change.

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `reversal_5d.py` | a five-day reversal `StrategyModel`: buys the weakest recent performers |
| `exchange.py` | a zero-friction academic venue listing exactly the sample's ten names |
| `observations.parquet` | daily OHLCV, one row per (close, instrument) |
| `execution.parquet` | the venue table a run fills against |
| `instruments.csv`, `panel.json` | the names and the panel's shape |
| `instruments_stock.parquet` | the roster: what each of the ten names IS (all shares) |
| `sample.yaml` | the one declaration that registers all of the above and the run `{run_id}` |

Three commands, from the directory that holds `.vqapr/` (or that will):

```bash
vqapr register {directory}/sample.yaml
vqapr check {run_id}
vqapr run {run_id}
```

Then `vqapr show run {run_id}` and `vqapr show strategy {run_id}` read the record back.

The panel is deliberately unbalanced: `{late_listed}` lists 200 sessions late and `{delisted}`
stops 250 sessions early, so the strategy meets a name with too little history and a name that
disappears from under a position -- the two things a balanced sample would let you assume away.

**The data is not market data.** It was cut from real KRX sessions and then transformed: codes
and names replaced, prices rescaled and jittered, volumes scaled. Use it to learn the shape of a
run, not to draw a conclusion about a market.
