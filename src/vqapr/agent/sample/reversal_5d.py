"""A five-day reversal on the sample panel.

This Strategy knows nothing about listings, halts, or delistings. Tradability is an execution-time
fact it cannot observe at the callback, so guessing at it here would be wrong (see
`docs/implementations/013-halted-names-do-not-stop-a-rebalance.md`). Eligibility is decided only by
whether the declared lookback is present, which removes a name that has just listed and a name that
has stopped trading without either being a special case.
