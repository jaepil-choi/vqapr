"""A shipped compliance rule: no name larger than ``max(cap, benchmark_i)`` in the marked book.

The observing half of `vqapr.portfolio.bounds.single_name_cap`. The ceiling is the rule's own:
its `cap` is its own parameter and the benchmark arrives through its own `inputs()` declaration,
read as of the market-clock instant it observes at. Whether the strategy built inside the same
cap is not this rule's concern -- the two are compared in the report, and their disagreeing is
information rather than an error (design §7.2, owner decision).

The benchmark is validated through the allocation contract **before** any measurement is made:
a missing or invariant-violating benchmark fails the observation rather than assuming zero,
which would silently cap that name at `cap` on the strength of a gap in the data.
