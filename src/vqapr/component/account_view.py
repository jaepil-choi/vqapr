"""What a callback is handed beyond its own call: the committed account.

`EconomicAccountView` is the account as one callback may see it -- an immutable snapshot, never the
live book. A value the engine constructs and the author only reads, which is why it sits below
`call.py`: a `StrategyCall` carries it, and a `Compliance` rule's `observe` receives it.

    """A bounded, immutable snapshot of the committed Account for one callback.

    **`values` was missing, and its absence made a whole rule shape inexpressible.** This view
    carried `positions` -- quantities -- plus one aggregate `nav`, and a weight is
    `value / nav`. Quantities cannot become weights without prices, so no weight-based rule
    could be written against this type at all, which is what both shipped rules are. The
    gap went unnoticed because monitoring ran on the engine's `MarkBatch` instead, on the other
    side of the surface split this contract exists to remove.

    So `values` is the marked value per instrument. Quantities stay, because a rule about lot
    sizes or a short position asks about quantity and would otherwise have to divide back out.

    **`values` is `None` where the framework has no marks to offer, and that is not zero.** A
    Strategy callback fires before the event it decides for is executed or valued, so what
    it sees is the previous valuation's marks -- committed, and therefore point-in-time -- and
    before the first valuation there are none; a Compliance rule fires against a marked
    account and always has them. An empty mapping would make `weight()` return a confident zero
    for every name and every weight rule report `passed`, so absence refuses instead.
