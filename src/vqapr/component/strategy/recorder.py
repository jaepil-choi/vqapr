"""What an author declares to record, and the write-only recorder that stages it.

The authoring contract's third piece, beside `authoring.py` (the four Components and the values
they exchange) and `authoring_lookback.py`. A `StrategyModel` returns `TableSpec`s from
`tables()` and writes rows into the `InvocationRecorder` the engine hands it; only the Flow's
acceptance root publishes what was staged. Both were `evidence/tables.py` and
`evidence/recorder.py` until record `188`: `evidence/` grouped three files by *who reads them*
rather than by what they are, and these two are one thing -- a declaration and the buffer that
enforces it -- so they are one module.

`vqapr.public` exports both, which is how an author imports them.

    market-clock instant -- append whole columns. Either way what is staged is one list per

    The field names are checked once, by `TableSpec`; a row is held to *those* names by one set

    `sequence` is the run's, not the recorder's (record `225`, after the four kinds campaign's
    `205`): the run hands every recorder it builds its own `sequencer`, so the column is a
