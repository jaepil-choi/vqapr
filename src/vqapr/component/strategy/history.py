"""The account history a StrategyModel declares, and the projection it receives.

Moved here from `account/history.py` by the layering campaign (record `192`). The two halves were
in different packages and each needed the other: `authoring` imported the field names and the
projection type, and `account/history.py` imported the declaration back under `TYPE_CHECKING` --
a cycle, deferred rather than resolved. Its own comment said as much:

    The declaration is `authoring`'s, and `authoring` imports this module for the field
    names and the projection type, so the type lives here as an annotation only.

They are one contract. `AccountHistoryInput` is what a StrategyModel declares and `AccountHistory`
is what it is then handed, and neither is meaningful without the other, so they live in one module
and the deferral is gone rather than relocated. The account package keeps the behaviour that
produces the marks; this is the shape the author sees.

**Declared, like data.** A consumer states which fields it reads and how far back, exactly as it
declares a `DataRequirement`. There is no unbounded read: the lookback is required, so a
projection costs the declared window rather than the run so far. An open-ended read would be
O(history) per callback and therefore quadratic over a run, which is the cost shape the framework
works to keep out of the hot path.

**Retained only if declared.** The declaration is also what the run keeps in memory. A run whose
Strategy declares nothing retains one mark -- the current valuation -- and nothing else. Full
history belongs in the recorder, which streams it to parquet instead of holding it resident.

The fields are fixed because a fixed set is what makes "asked for something outside it" fail
before the run starts rather than during it. Every field here is a value `commit` and `mark`
already computed; history adds no arithmetic of its own, so it cannot disagree with the account
it describes.
