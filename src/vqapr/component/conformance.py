"""One verdict on whether a component honours its extension contract.

Canon §10.2 says the four extension points *"enter through the same door and pass the same
conformance"*. Registration is that door (`prepare_component` below proves,
`workspace/registration.py` writes), and it already proves a
component **loads**: the fingerprint matches, the object constructs, it implements its contract
type, and it declares its data requirements.

Loading is not conformance. A component can construct perfectly and still be unusable, because the
methods Flow will call are not the methods it defined. Renaming a parameter of
`Compliance.observe`, or dropping `DataModel.compute` onto a class that inherits an abstract stub,
produces an object that registers cleanly and fails in the middle of a run — where the reported
stage names the run rather than the component that caused it.

**The suite is a superset of the load, never a copy of it.** `conformance()` calls the same
`load_*` function registration calls, then checks what loading does not: that every method the
contract declares is present, callable, and **accepts the positional call Flow will make**.
There is one implementation and two entrances — `pytest` and `vqapr register` — so a component
cannot pass one and fail another. There is deliberately no `vqapr check`: registration already
calls this code, and a component that is not registered is not yet anything Flow can run.

Its input is a `ComponentRef` (canon §10.3), which is the same type a shipped component and a
user-authored one both arrive as. There is deliberately no branch that can tell them apart, and
`academic` and `krx` are the first two implementations to pass it.

What it cannot check is deliberately absent, and the boundary is sharper than it looks. Whether a
callback returns the *declared type* is not knowable here either: an annotation can lie and most
components carry none, so the only honest verdict comes from the value itself at the call site.
The Flow already takes that verdict — `validate_economic_intent` for an intent, `_validated_output`
for computed rows, an `isinstance` gate for projected bounds — and it belongs there, where the
returned object exists.

**Shipped, and here rather than in `testing/`.** Canon 10.3 ships this instead of keeping it in
`tests/`, so a user can prove their own component before registering it rather than reading our
test suite to guess the contract. That is a packaging fact, not a layering one, and for a while it
bought a package of its own -- which put `extension/prepare.py` below the suite it calls while
the suite imported `extension/loading.py` back. A cycle, at module scope, that only import order
kept quiet. Registration is the door and conformance is what the door proves, so the two live
together (record `193`); `vqapr.public` re-exports `conformance`, which is how a user reaches it
and why the move costs them nothing.

So this suite answers exactly one question: **will Flow be able to call this component at all.**
Arity is decidable before a run; the returned value is not. Checking the first here and the second
there is the whole division of labour, and widening either one into the other's territory would
trade a real verdict for a guess.

`prepare_component` is the registration side of the same door: fingerprint the source, build the
`ComponentRef`, and prove the component conforms. It writes nothing -- the workspace does.
