"""What a Component declares it reads from a registered dataset, and that as engine requirements.

`inputs()` is how every role -- a DataModel, a StrategyModel, a Compliance rule -- says what it
needs, and it says it the same way: a `DatasetInput` per alias the author names.
`requirements_for` is the translation the engine applies to one of those, one `DataRequirement`
per field.

This module sits below `component.py` rather than beside it, because `Component.requirements()`
reads a `DatasetInput` and `DataModel` is a `Component`: keeping the declaration below the class
that consumes it is what stops the two from importing each other.
