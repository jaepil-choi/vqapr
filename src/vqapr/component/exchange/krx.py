"""KRX execution profile.

This profile implements a declared, deliberately partial set of KRX rules. It claims exactly what
it implements and nothing else (PRD 6.3) -- **and it claims it as data.** `KrxExchange.settings`
is the declaration: the quantity unit, the commission and sale-tax rates in force, whether the
daily price band is on, how a short is answered, how an unaffordable buy is answered, and
`not_modelled`, the list of what this venue does not do. A run records that mapping beside the
venue's fingerprint, so a reader of the record learns what was modelled without opening this file
(design §6.1: *the schema is the venue's; the framework knows only that a venue has settings*).

What the settings switch is the venue's own business. The rates are constructor parameters, so
the same class registered twice with different config is two venues with two fingerprints and two
identities -- a tax-free KRX is a different experiment, and the warehouse keeps it apart.
