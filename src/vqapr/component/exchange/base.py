"""The Exchange role: a tool on the market clock that fills an order batch.

An Exchange is called at the instant a pending intent targets, with an `ExecutionCall`: the order
batch, the execution table read exactly at that instant, the account the orders are sized against,
the project's instrument dictionary, and its own rules bound to that dictionary. It returns the
fills. How it fills is entirely the venue's own business; what a venue models is its `settings`, a
mapping it declares and the run records beside its fingerprint.

The checks every profile makes about a call -- which requests the snapshot can answer, the rows they
name, the requests against the listings (`accepted_requests`, `requested_rows`, `validate_requests`)
-- live here once; a profile owns only how it fills. Shipped profiles are beside this module
(`academic.py`, `krx.py`) and enter through the same door as a user's.
