"""Load a registered component and adapt it to the contract the engine calls.

This module is the extension loading authority, and `vqapr.component.loading` is where it lives.

**It was not always.** Until record `110` the implementation sat in
`vqapr._internal.extensions.loading` with a four-line forwarding shim at this path, whose
docstring promised deletion "when the internal-transition closes". That promise was made in a file
marked temporary and was still true six months later, by which point a boundary test pinned the
shim's existence. Record `110` discharged it the other way: the shim's path became the real
module's path, so no caller changed a line and the temporary file stopped existing rather than
being renewed. See `docs/design/agent-first-surface.md` for the surface ruling this serves.
