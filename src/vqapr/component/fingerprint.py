"""Content fingerprints for project-local extension components.

This module is the extension fingerprint authority, and `vqapr.component.fingerprint` is where
it lives.

**It was not always.** Until record `110` the implementation sat in
`vqapr._internal.extensions.fingerprint`
with a four-line forwarding shim at this path, whose docstring promised deletion "when the
internal-transition closes". That promise was made in a file marked temporary and was still true six
months later, by which point a boundary test pinned the shim's existence. Record `110` discharged it
the other way: the shim's path became the real module's path, so no caller changed a line and the
temporary file stopped existing rather than being renewed. See
`docs/design/agent-first-surface.md` for the surface ruling this serves.
