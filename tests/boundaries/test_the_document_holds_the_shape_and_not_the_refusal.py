"""The document is its own file, and the refusals moved once it was safe to move them.

Record `117`. `workspace.py` was 2,227 lines and the plan called for splitting it four ways. Only
the codec split was taken, and this file used to pin the measurement that decided it: an attempt
that moved `Workspace` away from `_workspace_error` measured **0 refusal codes added and 37
removed** -- every `workspace.dataset.*`, `workspace.schedule.*`, `workspace.component.*`,
`workspace.source.*` code and `dataset.register.span.absent` -- with a green test suite and a clean
lint. Four repairs were tried and none restored them.

**That constraint expired, and record `194` split the module.** The cost was never the split; it
was the resolver. `tests/characterization/refusal_codes.py` folds a `code` argument forwarded
through a helper, and until record `171` its index was per-file, so a helper in another module was
opaque and the codes silently left the baseline. Record `171` rebuilt `_SourceIndex` over every
module under `src/vqapr` at once, and says so in the past tense:

    A per-file index only ever resolved a code forwarded through a helper defined in the same
    file, so splitting a module dropped codes from the baseline.

The layering campaign measured that before moving anything rather than trusting the docstring
(`docs/refactoring/2026-09-08-the-layering-campaign.md` section 5): `_workspace_error` moved to a
probe module with its twenty-six callers left behind, and
`pytest tests/characterization/test_refusal_codes.py` reported **gained 0, lost 0**, with all 22
codes passed to it as literals still present. The probe was reverted and the real move followed.

**So what does this file still guard?** Not "the constructor stays with its callers" -- that
assertion is deleted, and deleting it is the point of this rewrite; leaving it would have made the
next reader restore a constraint the tree no longer has. What remains is the property the split was
*for*, which record `117` also stated and which nothing has retired: the document's shapes live in
one file that a later step can discard as a region, and that file raises no refusal of its own.

The second half is worth keeping even though the inventory could now follow a codec refusal. A
codec that raises is a codec that has opinions about validity, and `workspace/declarations.py` exists so
that pydantic holds the shape and `workspace/registration.py` holds the argument about what a wrong
shape means to a user. The assertion is about that division, not about the baseline any more.
