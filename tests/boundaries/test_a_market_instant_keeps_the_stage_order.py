"""AC-8 of the two-clocks campaign: one instant, one order, written once (design §3.1).

    ACCRUE -> EXECUTE -> VALUATION -> COMPLIANCE -> DECIDE

The market clock's four stages are dispatched by one method, `MarketClock.at`, and a decision
at the same instant is a separate event the loop sorts after it. Both halves are pinned here:
the source order of the dispatcher (a boundary, so a later edit cannot quietly reorder the
stages) and the lifecycle a real run leaves at an instant where a fill and a decision coincide.
