"""Every extension point is one callback that takes one Call and returns one judgment.

`test_the_layers_hold.py` says what may import what. This file says what the **shape** of an
extension point is (record `229`; the four kinds campaign's `203` wrote the rule first). The rule
the tree keeps:

> **A role takes one Call and returns one judgment. The Call is the whole of its authority.**

That second sentence is the load-bearing one. A `Call` is not a DTO -- it is a capability object,
and it is how point-in-time correctness is enforced by *inaccessibility* rather than by a rule
somebody has to remember (architecture 2.2, 10.1). What a role may reach is what its Call
exposes, so a new role answers "what can this see?" by naming one type, and a role that needs to
see more has to say so in a place a reader can find. Until `229` `Compliance.observe` took the
committed account beside its call, while the wiring table listed that account as a View the role
receives: the one place the table and a signature disagreed.

**Properties are not callbacks.** `compliance_id` and `Exchange.rules` are abstract too, and they
are identity and configuration rather than an invocation. The check below counts only abstract
members that are functions.

**What this does not check.** Whether the annotation is honest -- an annotation can lie, and
`component/conformance.py` is what checks the real object at registration, by arity, against the
call the run will actually make. This file checks the declared contract; that one checks the
component.
