"""Function-local `vqapr` imports are capped, so this refactoring cannot quietly grow them.

`pyproject.toml` explains why this package declines an import-linter:

> a misplaced type surfaces as a circular import, which Python reports without a tool.

**That premise is already false where it matters most.** A function-local import defers the cycle to
the first call, so Python stops reporting it -- and 111 of them exist. Two thirds sit in
`project.py` and the six `_internal/*_bridge.py` modules, which is the same S1 duplication the
structural audit is about: two definitions of one concept, and a translation layer that can only
avoid a cycle by importing late.

The ceiling is not a claim that deferred imports are wrong. Some are load-bearing, and the ones that
are say so. It is a ratchet: every step from here moves code between modules, and the cheapest wrong
way to fix a resulting circular import is a new function-local import. Without a cap, this
refactoring's own execution is the most likely thing to push the number up.

It is armed BEFORE the first code-moving step for that reason.

CEILING = 7  # record `277`: `cli/show.py` loads a component through the workspace's one door
"""Was 9 after record `234`. Record `277` (the CLI reads through the surfaces) replaced
`cli/show.py`'s function-local component loaders -- one per kind, two in `_model` and one in the
compliance branch -- with one `workspace.registry.load_registered` imported beside the names it
now takes from `vqapr.public`.

Was 10 after record `191`. Record `234` (one validation door) replaced `cli/list_.py`'s deferred
`build_roster`/`read_roster_table` pair with module-level imports of `data/validation.verify_roster`
and `domain/instruments.build_roster`: `workspace/registry.py` already imports the door at the top, so
there was no cycle to hide.

Was 12 after record `186` (the lazy roster import in `exchange/listings.py` moved to the top).
Record `191` (layering campaign M2) hoisted the two `accepted_requests` guards in
`exchange/execution_table.py`: they deferred `account.snapshot` and `orders.batches` because
`exchange` importing either at module level was a cycle, and both types are now
`domain/account_state.py` and `domain/orders.py`. The cycle is gone rather than deferred.

Measured at record `126`: 37 in total, with `JUSTIFIED` now empty.
Was 18 after record `149`. Record `162` (one-shape Step 7) removed `data/store.py`'s
`_window_types` and the two `ExecutionTable` guards in `exchange/conventions.py`:
each deferred an import that was a cycle, and the cycle is gone rather than deferred.
Then 15 -> 13 in the same record: `domain/roster.py` and `roster_export.py` folded into
`domain/instruments.py`, so the two deferred `build_roster`/`read_roster_table` pairs in
`cli/list_.py` and `declarations.py` became one statement each. The deferrals stayed; the count
is statements.

Was 23 after record `132`. Record `134` removed the function-local `Workspace` import in
`declarations._instruments`: the roster is staged on the transaction `_apply` already holds.

Was 35 after record `131`. Record `132` deleted `_internal/strategy_bridge.py` and
`_internal/models/agent_first.py` -- the adapter between the two StrategyModel classes -- and
the two deferred imports `extension/loading.py` needed to reach them; the bridge itself carried
the rest.

Was 41 after record `125`, 44 after record `124`, and 99 before that. Record `126` merged the
two lookback pairs into one class each, which deleted `engine_lookback` and the four deferred
imports it needed to name both sides of a translation that no longer exists.

Before that: Record `124` deleted `project.py`, five `_internal`
bridges and `extension/identity.py`, which between them held most of the deferred imports this
ratchet was counting — `project.py` alone deferred nearly all of its own. Record `125` took three
more out of `strategy_bridge`, which stopped importing `vqapr.public` at all once the Flow took
over stamping the intent. Lowering the constant in the same commit is what this ratchet is for.

Was 104 before that. Record `115` hoisted five function-local imports out of `run/roster.py` and
`flow/records.py` that had been deferred inside `vqapr.public`, where the facade sits above
everything; that justification did not travel when the code moved to `flow/`, and
`run/assemble.py` already imports `vqapr.workspace` (now `vqapr.workspace.registry`) eagerly.

This number may go DOWN freely; it may not go up.

Lowering it is the point -- resolving the S1 duplication removes most of these by construction. When
a step lowers the count, it lowers this constant in the same commit, so the ratchet tightens rather
than leaving slack for the next accident to fill.
