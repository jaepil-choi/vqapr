"""The package is a DAG, and this file is where that is written down.

`pyproject.toml` declines an import-linter and gives a reason:

> a misplaced type surfaces as a circular import, which Python reports without a tool.

`test_a_deferred_import_states_its_reason.py` already records that the premise is false where it
matters: a function-local import defers the cycle to the first call, so Python stops reporting it.
That file caps the deferrals. This file is the other half -- it says what may import what, so a
cycle has to be *declared* here before it can exist, rather than being discovered by an audit.

**Why a table and not a contract file.** `pyproject.toml`'s second argument stands: a contract must
not drive type placement. So the table below is not a permission system -- it is a written record of
the altitudes the package already has, and the one rule that keeps them:

> **A value two packages exchange lives in `domain/`. A package holds behaviour.**

Every cycle the layering campaign measured (2026-09-08, `docs/refactoring/`) broke that rule the
same way: `Fill` sat in `exchange/`, `OrderBatch` in `orders/`, `AccountSnapshot` in `account/`,
`AccountHistory` in `account/` -- each a value two packages pass to each other, each forcing the
package that owns it to be imported by a package below it.

**Strictly lower, not lower-or-equal.** A module may import only a *strictly* lower layer. Equal
layers would permit `a -> b` and `b -> a` between two packages that share a number, which is the
cycle this file exists to forbid. It is also why sibling packages that genuinely depend on each
other carry different numbers rather than being called peers.

**The gaps are deliberate.** Layers are spaced by ten so a package can be inserted between two
others without renumbering the tree, and so the campaign's intermediate states (`orders/` before it
folds into `exchange/`, `testing/` before it folds into `extension/`) have a truthful number while
they still exist.

**`OPEN` is a ratchet, not an exemption list.** It holds the violations measured before the first
code-moving step, each naming the milestone that closes it. It may shrink; it may not grow. A step
that closes an edge deletes its line in the same commit -- the same discipline
`test_a_deferred_import_states_its_reason.py` applies to `CEILING`, and for the same reason: this
refactoring is itself the most likely thing to add a violation.

This file absorbs `test_domain_imports_only_itself.py` (deleted): `domain` is layer 0, and layer 0
may import nothing, which is that test generalised to every package.

It stays here rather than being deleted with the last entry. A campaign that needs to open an edge
for a step should say so in the table and close it in the commit that closes it, which is what this
dict is for; deleting it would leave the next such campaign with `assert not violations` and no way
to express a bounded exception except by deleting the assertion.
