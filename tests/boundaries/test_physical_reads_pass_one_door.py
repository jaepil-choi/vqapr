"""A physical read is measured at one door, and only there (`docs/issues/095`, record `234`).

The scan's check kernels -- the queries that describe a file, prove a key, measure a span,
count non-finite values, or count non-positive prices -- are what "validating a file" costs.
Until record `234` three modules called them with three shapes, and the same execution table
was scanned at registration, at preflight and at run for facts registration had already
established. `data/verification.py` is the one module that may call them now; every later reader
asks `require_verified` for the file's identity instead.

Held by reading the source, not by mocking: a new module that opens a kernel of its own fails
here by file and line, with the door named.
