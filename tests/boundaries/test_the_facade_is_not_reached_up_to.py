"""The facade boundary, as a test rather than as prose.

`docs/design/agent-first-surface.md` ("The ruling -- 2026-08-28") defines exactly one instrument for
this boundary: the count of modules under `src/` containing a **real import** of `vqapr.public`,
excluding events inside string literals. It records a verified value of 12 and names all
twelve. It also gives the AST command to re-measure it.

What it did not have was a test. `docs/issues/archive/028` is what that cost: `fix/015a-extract-judgments`
moved the judgments below the CLI and let them keep importing the facade, taking the count to 13,
and the whole 1,400-test suite stayed green, because the tripwire lived in a document nobody
executes.
The regression was found by an owner-requested audit, not by the mechanism meant to catch it.

`vqapr.public` is the CLI's supported implementation surface and sits **above** `flow/`, `domain/`,
`workspace/` and the rest. A module in those layers importing it reaches back up through the thing
it is supposed to sit beneath -- and the import still works, so nothing fails until someone reads
for it.

**The debt is paid, and `PERMITTED` is now just `PERMANENT`.** This file used to keep two sets
apart on purpose: the CLI and the shipped samples using the surface the facade exists to be, and a
second set of boundary violations held open with an expiry attached, which is where review `R7`
found them -- *"면제 목록에 넣어 두었고, 만료일이 없다"*. Both halves are now discharged.

**Record `124` closed six of the seven.** `project.py` and five of the six `_internal` bridges are
deleted, and the exemptions they held went with them. What remained was `strategy_bridge.py`, which
was always the one entry with a live importer outside the cluster (`extension/loading.py`) and so
the one that could never be closed by deleting anything.

**Record `125` closed the seventh, and not by deleting it either.** The bridge imported
`EconomicPortfolioIntent`, `PortfolioTarget`, `IntentSourceRef` and `NoDecision` from the facade in
order to STAMP an intent -- minting the UUID, rebuilding provenance, copying the account version.
Moving that stamping into `run/engine/loop.py`, where the Flow already derived every one of those
values to check the bridge's copy of them, left the bridge with nothing to import. The file is
still there and still translates one call surface into the other; it simply no longer reaches up.

So every importer of `vqapr.public` under `src/` is now a module using the facade for exactly what
the facade is for. If this list ever grows again, the entry is a violation and not an exemption:
there is no longer a second set to put it in.
