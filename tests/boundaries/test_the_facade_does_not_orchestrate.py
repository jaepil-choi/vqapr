"""`vqapr.public` names things. It does not do them.

Record `111`. `public.py` was 776 lines, of which **450 were function bodies** — `run` (122),
`_registered_roster` (75), `_freeze_record` (72), `_contract_report` (57), `roster_report` (38),
`_as_loaded_identity` (23). The package's documented surface was also its orchestrator, and the
consequences were not theoretical:

* every module below it that needed one of those functions had to import the top-level facade to
  get it, which is the fan-in `docs/issues/archive/028` records;
* `cli/run.py` imported `_registered_roster` — a **private** name — from the documented surface,
  which is the shape that tells you a module has outgrown its role.

The bodies moved to the layers that own them. `vqapr.public` re-exports every one, so no caller and
no emitted scaffold changed a line. This file stops the orchestration coming back.

It is a shape check rather than a list of banned names, because the failure mode is gradual: one
helper at a time, each defensible on its own. It was a size check too until 2026-09-01; see the
note above `MAX_BODY_STATEMENTS` for why the size half was retired and what it never measured.

# A line-count ceiling on this file used to live here (`MAX_LINES`, last 328). The owner retired
# line-count caps as acceptance criteria on 2026-09-01; record `118` carries the ruling and the
# three measurements behind it. The short version is that the number never measured the thing it
# was named for. Of the 328 lines it last pinned, 254 were imports and `__all__` -- pure surface
# declaration for the 132 names this module exists to export -- so the cap was mostly counting how
# many things `vqapr.public` is a surface FOR, and got tighter every time the package exported
# something new. Step 7's acceptance ("under 250") was unreachable for that reason and had to be
# amended in record `111`; the ceiling policing it was then set 69 lines above the real value and
# had to be corrected in record `113`; and in record `117` the same style of cap (800 lines per
# workspace module) contradicted its own step's other clause and cost a Step-11 revert.
#
# What replaced it is the check below, which was always the one carrying the meaning: a facade
# delegates and does not compute. That is a shape, and shape is what "this file has outgrown its
# role" actually is. A file can double in `__all__` without breaking it and cannot smuggle a run
# loop past it.
