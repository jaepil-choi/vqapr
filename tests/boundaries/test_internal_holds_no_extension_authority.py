"""`_internal` has no extension authorities left, and the two shared primitives are named.

**This file's original subject no longer exists, and that is the outcome rather than a loss.** It
was written for `docs/issues/archive/029`: four modules under `extension/` were forwarding shims over
`_internal/extensions/*`, and the rule was that every caller reach the authorities through the one
door, so the shims' eventual deletion would be four files removed with every stale import breaking
loudly rather than a grep.

Record `110` discharged that promise the other way round. Instead of deleting the shims and
repointing callers at `_internal`, the implementations moved **to** the shim paths. No caller changed
a line — that is what the one-door rule bought — and `src/vqapr/_internal/extensions/` stopped
existing. A door with nothing behind it is not a door.

What survives is the discipline the rule was an instance of: `_internal` is not a general-purpose
import target, and the modules that may be reached from outside it are enumerated rather than
assumed.
