"""`register` is the one door into a workspace, so its refusals are pinned here.

`test_commands.py` drives the happy path end to end: `register` the data, `new` a strategy,
`register` the declaration `new` emitted, then `run`. What is pinned here is the part a happy path
cannot show — that a declaration which would produce an unusable workspace is refused before
anything is written, and that the validation is real rather than transcription.
