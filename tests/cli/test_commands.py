"""The CLI is the surface a first-time user actually types, so it is driven here as typed.

`test_envelope.py` covers the envelope's shape and asserts the parser *mentions* every command.
Mentioning is not running: before this file, no test invoked `new`, `register`, `list` or `run`,
so the whole `runs: -> register -> RunDefinition -> freeze -> run` path was unexecuted.
These tests call `main(argv)` and read the JSON it emits, which is exactly what an agent gets.

Datasets, execution inputs, components and runs are declared through `vqapr register`, which is
the command that closed that gap. This file previously reached past the CLI into the library for
all of them, under a docstring admitting the CLI could not register them; the workspace below is
now reachable by typing `vqapr` commands only, which is the property that matters.

Since the two-clocks campaign a run declares its own schedule clock (`schedule`, `timezone`,
`at`): there is no schedule to register and no binding to write, so the fixture is one file
shorter than it was.
