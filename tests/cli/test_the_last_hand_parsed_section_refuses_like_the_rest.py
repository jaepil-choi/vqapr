"""`instruments:` refuses a misspelled key the way every other section does.

One-shape campaign Step 5 (M5b). Every declaration section's key set is a pydantic model and its
refusals come out of `declarations.refusals_from` -- except `instruments:`, which read `tables`
with the hand-written `_require_keys` and then took whatever mapping it found. So a typo under
`instruments:` fell through to the refusal written for the RETIRED `instruments: {<id>: {tables:
...}}` shape, and that refusal's `fix` told the reader to *"remove the id line and lift `tables:`
up one level"* -- advice for a mistake they had not made.

The retired-shape refusal is still there and still right for the shape it names; what changed is
that it is narrowed to that shape, and anything else is answered by the permitted key set and the
nearest spelling, which is what `019` and `017` bought for every other section.
