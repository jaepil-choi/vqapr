"""Every `vqapr new` kind says what to do with the file it wrote.

`docs/issues/archive/026`. `new --help` promised:

    Every kind reports the file to hand `vqapr register` as `declaration`

and four of the nine kinds -- `dataset`, `run-spec`, `agendas`, `execution-input` -- reported `path`
only. The reporter had read that as a guarantee across all nine and planned to script off it.

The promise was wrong in **both** directions then. Four kinds did not emit the key, and one of
those four could not honestly emit it: a run SPEC was not registrable, so the envelope answered
`registrable: false` for it and the help said so.

Since record 139 a run is a `runs:` section of a declaration document, so the one exception is
gone: `vqapr new run` emits a declaration `vqapr register` takes, and every kind answers the
caller's actual question -- *what do I do with this file?* -- with `declaration`. Record 148
retired `agendas` (a run declares its own sessions and wall time), so eight kinds remained;
record 172 added `sample`, which writes a directory rather than a file and reports the
declaration inside it.
