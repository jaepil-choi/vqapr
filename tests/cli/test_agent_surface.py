"""The properties an agent depends on before it knows anything about vqapr.

Two of them cannot be observed from inside the process:

- **`--help` must survive the console encoding.** `capsys` replaces stdout with a UTF-8 capture,
  so an in-process test passes even when the real console cannot encode the text. Help text
  containing an em dash exited non-zero with empty stdout on a cp949 console and every in-process
  test stayed green, so these run through a real subprocess with the encoding forced.
- **`python -m vqapr` must work**, which is a question about the module, not about `main()`.

The rest assert the refusals an agent hits while learning the surface: a first `list` before
anything exists, a path that was mistyped, a retried command, and a spec that is not finished.
Each of those must arrive as a typed stage rather than as `unhandled`, because `unhandled` tells
an agent the framework broke and sends it to read source instead of fixing its own input.
