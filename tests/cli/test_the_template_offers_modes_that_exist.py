"""The run template offers account modes that actually exist.

`docs/issues/archive/017`. `vqapr new run-spec` (now `vqapr new run`) emitted `mode: LONG_ONLY` with the
comment `# LONG_ONLY or LONG_SHORT`, reading as a closed set of exactly two. The book was
long/short, so the author took the value the template offered. **`LONG_SHORT` does not exist and
never did** --
the members are `LONG_ONLY` and `SIGNED` -- and the refusal that followed carried
`observed: KeyError: 'LONG_SHORT'`, an exception repr where the permitted set belonged.

`slowed` for a reporter who could go read the enum. `blocked` for a first-time user without it on
screen.
