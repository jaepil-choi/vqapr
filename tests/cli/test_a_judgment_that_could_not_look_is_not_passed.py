"""A judgment that could not answer is reported as blocked, never as passed.

`docs/issues/archive/077`. `judgments()` has the right mechanism -- each judge runs inside a wrapper that
turns an exception into a BLOCKED entry, and its own comment says why: "the judgment did not find
nothing, it could not look, and a run nothing was proven about would then report as clean and
ready." Five helpers caught INSIDE that wrapper and returned an empty result, which is
indistinguishable from "asked the question, found nothing wrong". `check` therefore answered

    {"passed": ["workspace", "run", "judgments"], "blocked": []}

on a run whose look-ahead judgment -- AC-C5, the one `docs/issues/archive/015` exists for -- never ran.

Two reproductions, from unrelated causes, both of which used to produce exactly that report. The
run was still refused in both, but only because preflight happens to reach the same doors, and
nothing pinned that coupling. These tests pin the report instead: the property is that `check`
distinguishes "this passed" from "this never ran" from "this failed", which is what the verb is
for.

Owner decision, 2026-09-04: when a judgment cannot answer AND preflight refuses the same
underlying defect, the envelope carries BOTH. They are two different statements.
