"""A mistyped closed-set value is refused with the permitted set, not an exception repr.

`docs/issues/archive/017`, message half. `AccountMode[str(...).upper()]` raised a bare `KeyError`, which
reached the envelope as:

    "observed": "KeyError: 'LONG_SHORT'"

The reader is told their value was rejected and left to discover the legal ones themselves -- for
this journey, by reading the enum in installed source. A closed set is the one case where a refusal
can always be complete: the alternatives are known, finite, and cheap to print.

Since record `139` a run is a registered declaration, so the account mode is judged where every
other closed set in a declaration is judged -- `declarations._enum`, the helper `register` learned
this on expensively (`fill.selector`: six consecutive guesses on price words, because the field
name argues for a vocabulary the members do not use).
