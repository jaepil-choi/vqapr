"""The skill describes the provenance the package actually has.

`docs/issues/023`, docs half only. The skill claimed:

    Registrations are immutable identities, not editable configuration rows. Re-registering changed
    content under the same id is refused because an old run may depend on the original declaration.

**That refusal was removed on purpose.** `docs/issues/archive/009` argued the component fingerprint should
report rather than refuse, because editing a registered component is the ordinary development loop,
and `tests/run/test_edit_loop.py` is the acceptance test it asked for. So the skill was describing
a gate the package had deliberately stopped having, and sending readers to invent a new component id
for every edit.

**What is NOT being built here.** 023 also proposes a `matches` / `differs` / `absent` statement in
`show run`, reporting whether the source at the registered path still hashes to the digest that run
recorded. That is the held product half (023p). It is undecided, so the narrowed text must state the
current state **without implying such a read-back exists** -- and it must never become a gate, which
009's "What not to do" forbids outright.
