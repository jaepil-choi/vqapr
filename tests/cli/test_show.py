"""`vqapr show run <id>` answers from the frozen record, and answers the same thing it froze.

AC-R5 asks for two properties that sound like one. They are not.

**A cold process gets the same values.** Proved in `tests/run/test_run_records.py` with real
spawned processes, because that is the only honest way to prove it.

**The output and the record carry the same field set.** Proved here, and proved structurally
rather than by example: one serializer produces both, so a field cannot be added to one and
forgotten in the other. A test that compared one run's output to one run's record would pass while
leaving that drift possible for every other run.
