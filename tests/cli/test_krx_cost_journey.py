"""The assertion whose absence let 1,300 tests pass while 64 fills recorded `0.00`.

A first-time-user journey was asked "do ETFs cost less to trade than stocks?" and could not answer
it. `vqapr new exchange` emitted a subclass of `AcademicExchange` whose `_rule()` returned four
arguments and no `buy`/`sell`, so the agent copied that shape onto a `KrxExchange` subclass and
produced a Korean venue that charged nothing. Registration accepted it, preflight accepted it,
`check` returned `ok`, the run completed, and every fill carried `commission: 0.00, tax: 0.00`.

Nothing refused, because nothing was wrong: a zero-cost venue is a legal, complete, reproducible
run. What was wrong was the scaffold, which taught the shape that silently zeroes the capability on
the one profile whose entire reason for existing is that it charges.

So this test asserts on **fill values**, never on registration returning `ok`. It drives the
emitted `--profile krx` scaffold end to end and checks the three facts the mission needed:
commission on both sides, sale tax on the stock, and no sale tax on the ETF.
