"""`register` speaks the point-in-time convention (`027`); a dataset names the run that wrote
it and a component list can be asked who reads a dataset (`082`).

`027`, reopened by the owner: nothing made a convention be spoken aloud. `available_at`,
`trade_at`, `at`, `timezone`, the fill handles and `trade_price` are the fields whose whole content is
their meaning, and an author who typed them had never been told what they commit to. The rule
settled there: **one sentence per PIT-bearing concept, or nothing** -- a restatement long enough
to scroll past is the paragraph it was meant to replace.

`082`: "who reads this dataset" took 41 processes and 36 seconds because the only verb was
`show model`, one component per process; and a materialized dataset could not say which run
wrote it although the run knew at registration. One-shape campaign Step 5, M5e.
