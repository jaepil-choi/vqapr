"""`run` refuses what `check` refuses, in the same codes, for a registered run.

The defect this closes (`docs/issues/archive/015`): the eight judgments lived only in `check`, so a run
with a real look-ahead -- a fill at 15:30 with decisions at or after it -- was refused by `check`
and executed by `run`. The run then wrote a permanent record that `vqapr list runs` shows beside
legitimate runs with nothing marking it, and no command deletes a run. A reader could not tell.

The property under test is the sentence the reporter wanted to be able to say and could not:
*`check` and `run` enforce the same rules, so a green `run` means what a green `check` means.*

A run is a registered declaration since record 139, so the defects here are ones a REGISTERED run
can carry: `register` already refuses a reversed period and a bare date, and those never reach
either verb. What registration accepts and the judgments refuse is the look-ahead itself, and an
account whose declared mode contradicts its opening positions.
