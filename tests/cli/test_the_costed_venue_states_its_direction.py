"""The skill says the KRX profile is long-only, where a reader decides to use it.

`docs/issues/archive/020`. `vqapr new exchange <id> --profile krx` is the realistic profile and the skill's
Costs section recommends it. `krx_listings` produces `ListingAccess.LONG_ONLY` rules, so

    --profile krx  +  initial_account.mode: SIGNED

is a pairing nothing refuses at scaffold time and that cannot hold a position. The scaffold's own
class docstring says it in passing -- *"long positions only"* -- but the skill's two cost sections,
which are where a reader goes to *decide* this, never mentioned direction at all. The reporter spent
about ten minutes re-reading them looking for the sentence that turned out not to be there.
