"""`run.complete` says what the orders did, not only that the simulation executed.

`docs/issues/archive/039`. A market-neutral run returned `{"ok": true, "events": 732,
"account_version": 244}`. Its long side landed on 0.500 at every rebalance; its short side never
did, and by December the book carried **+9.1% of NAV in unintended net long exposure** -- a strategy
whose whole premise is neutrality running a material directional bet.

The cause was faithful market friction: names not tradable at the fill instant, skewed toward what a
reversal signal wants to short. It was correctly modelled and correctly labelled -- 1,481 of 47,318
fill rows carried `reason: nontradable`. **Nothing aggregated them.** The reporter's own summary:

> `ok: true` on this run means "the simulation executed", and I had been reading it as "the book I
> declared is the book that was held". Those differ by nine percent of NAV.

The follow-up made the case stronger rather than weaker. Most of the gap turned out to be a bug in
the reporter's own model, and the signal that would have exposed it on day one was a 3.1% zero-dealt
rate against a 1.2% baseline -- a comparison nobody could make, because no number was reported.
