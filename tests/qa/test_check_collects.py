"""Adversarial attacks on claim 2: `check` collects ALL independent failures, not just some.

Written against a version where two of these were BROKEN. They are fixed; the tests remain as the
pins that keep them fixed, and this docstring records what was actually wrong rather than the
speculation it started as.

1. **Several independent defects at once** -- `check` reports every judgment that can answer and
   caps nothing. Since record `139` the run is a registration, so the defects here are the ones
   registration admits: a look-ahead, a short opening in a long-only book, a strategy reading a
   dataset nobody registered -- and the preflight refusal that follows them.

2. **A judgment raising an unexpected exception type.** It used to propagate straight out of
   `check()`, crashing the one verb that exists in order never to crash. `judgments` now catches
   bare `Exception`, records the judgment as `blocked` with its exception type, withholds
   `judgments` from `passed`, and returns `ok: false`. The other judgments still report.

3. **Three advertised codes that could never fire.** `dataset.unregistered`,
   `field.absent` and `lookback.uncovered` read requirements off the raw `ComponentRef`
   that `workspace.component()` returns -- which has no `requirements` attribute at all, so a
   `getattr(..., ())` fallback always won and the loop body never executed. `check` now LOADS the
   component, and all three fire; this file proves the first of them end to end below.
