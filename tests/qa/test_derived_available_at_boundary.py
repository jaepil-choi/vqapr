"""Adversarial attack on claim 6: `derived_available_at` refuses look-ahead, boundary is `<=`.

Three instants around `evaluation_time`, at one-microsecond resolution:
- exactly at the boundary: must NOT refuse (`<=`, not `<`)
- one microsecond before: must NOT refuse
- one microsecond after: MUST refuse, and the refusal must name the dataset

`derived_available_at` is deliberately probed directly with a hand-built `AccessRecord` rather
than through a full simulation, so the boundary is tested at exactly the resolution Python's
`datetime` supports and not diluted by whatever coarser cadence a fixture schedule happens to use.
