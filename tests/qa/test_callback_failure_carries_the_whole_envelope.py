"""A failure raised inside the strategy callback carries every advertised field.

The skill states the guarantee without qualification -- *every entry carries `code`, `status`,
`source`, `requirement`, `observed`, `fix` and `cause`* -- and tells the reader to read `fix`
first, because it is the sentence that fixes this event.

A raise inside `decide()` delivered four of the six fields of the day. `fix`, `explain` and
`source` were absent entirely, and `requirement` degraded to "the guarded boundary must complete
without raising", which is a statement about this package's plumbing rather than about anything
the author did. Recorded as `docs/issues/archive/016`, which is the cross-cutting half of three separate
entries in the journey log. Record `171` replaced `explain` with `status` and put the exception
itself on the entry as `cause`.
