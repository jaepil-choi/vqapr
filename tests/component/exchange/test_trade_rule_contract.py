"""Two contracts a venue's rule must keep, both found by comparing profiles against each other.

1. **Quantity is two independent checks.** ``minimum_quantity`` and ``quantity_step`` answer
   different questions, and collapsing them into a ``quantize`` round-trip silently drops the
   minimum for a divisible instrument.
2. **A subclass field reaches the fingerprint.** A venue-specific regime -- a price-limit rate, a
   lot-unit convention -- is part of the declaration, so two rules that differ in it must not look
   identical to the workspace.
