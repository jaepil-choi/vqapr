"""The invariants both execution profiles hold, pinned once against both.

Issue `002` lists five that follow from Architecture 6.1 and are true of any profile. They were
implied by scattered per-profile tests and asserted nowhere as a set, which is what let the two
profiles carry twenty duplicated lines of the contract check between them without anything
noticing.

Point 5 is the one worth writing down before it is needed: ``|dealt| <= |requested|`` is an
INEQUALITY that is currently always an equality. Writing it as an inequality is what makes room for
a partial fill without changing the contract on the day one arrives.

**A partial fill cannot arise on the academic profile**, and that is structural rather than a
policy this file chose. Academic listings are fractional, so a plan sizes exactly to the cash it
has and leaves no rounding residual; cash exhaustion mid-batch is a whole-share artifact. The
equality therefore holds there for a reason, while on a venue profile it holds only until whole
shares and charged costs disagree with the plan's arithmetic.
