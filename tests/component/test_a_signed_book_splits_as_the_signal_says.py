"""`Rebalance.signed`, and the exactness `Rebalance.of` gained by delegating to `rescale`.

`docs/issues/archive/075`. The specification was ordinary for a market-neutral residual strategy: signed
weights whose absolute values sum to one, the long/short split being whatever the signal produced,
cash the net residual. `of` structurally cannot say it -- it takes two mappings and splits
`invested` EVENLY between them -- and its docstring pointed at the direct constructor, which the
author then had to fill by assembling three docstrings: what a valid `Budget` is, where the
canonical grid lives, and that quantising has to be settled afterwards.

Two things are tested here.

**`signed` exists and the ratio is the signal's.** Seven longs against eleven shorts comes out
0.389 long and -0.611 short, not 0.5/-0.5.

**`of` is now exact in gross.** It used to quantise and settle a second copy of `rescale`'s
arithmetic, with one book-wide residual placed on the single largest position. A crumb from the
SHORT side could therefore land on a LONG name: `of(long={"A": 1}, short={"B": 1, "C": 1, "D": 1})`
returned `A = 0.500000000001`, so a book asking for `invested=1` came out with gross
1.000000000002. `invested` is documented as gross exposure. Settling per side makes it exact.
