"""Every extension point enters through a door that proves the component loads.

Canon 10.2: the four extension points are named the same way, checked the same way, and
registered the same way. Before this, only StrategyModel and DataModel had that door. Exchange and
the observing role were assembled by hand from `ComponentRef.of` + `fingerprint_component` +
`register_component`, which records a reference without ever constructing the object.

That difference is not ergonomic. A hand-assembled reference to a broken Exchange registers
cleanly and fails in the middle of a run, where the reported stage names the run rather than the
registration that caused it. These tests pin that all four doors refuse before writing anything.
