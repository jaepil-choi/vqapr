"""Turning a declared alias into real point-in-time reads.

**These moved out of `_internal/pit_bridge.py` with record `128`** and the module went with
them. They existed there so `strategy_bridge` could serve an authored `read(alias)` while the
engine served `context.window.observations(requirement)`; now both contexts read through this
code and there is no boundary left for it to sit on.

What they pin is unchanged: declared fields are carried exactly, an alias fans out into one
requirement per field and joins back on `(instant, instrument)`, and a declaration the store
cannot serve raises rather than quietly producing a thin result.

**The resolver tests that stood below are gone with record `124`.** They drove
`project.resolver(...)`, and both resolver classes -- the catalog-backed one and the
store-backed one no module ever imported -- went with the Project cluster. What they read
through is exercised for real by every run in `tests/run/`.
