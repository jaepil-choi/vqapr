"""AC-A3 / AC-M8: the emitted scaffold registers, checks and runs with ZERO edits.

This is the landing gate the plan calls out, and the reason Step 7 lands as one unit: a scaffold
that is short and ceremony-free but does not RUN has moved the problem rather than solved it. Two
prior attempts reverted after splitting the scaffold from the loader and the sample.

Driven through the real CLI by argv, not by calling the functions, because the claim is about what
an agent typing these commands experiences.
