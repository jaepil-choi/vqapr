"""The scaffold is the authoring contract's proof, so its shape is pinned rather than described.

Every number here is a spec acceptance criterion, and each one was failing before this step: the
emitted strategy was 111 lines and made the author hand-mint a `uuid5`, assemble `source_refs` from
the window's accesses, and read `context.account.version` -- three pieces of framework bookkeeping
that have exactly one correct value and no bearing on the signal being expressed.

The point is not brevity for its own sake. A 40-line ceiling on CODE is enforceable evidence that
the ceremony is gone, because ceremony is what made the file long. Comments are not ceremony: since
record `267` they label every piece an author reaches for, and are bounded separately.
