"""What a Compliance rule is handed, built for a test.

Two builders, because the two cases are genuinely different and collapsing them hides which one a
test is exercising:

- `reading_call` wraps a real `ModelWindow` and is what a rule with declared `inputs()` needs. It
  is the production `ComplianceContext`, not a stand-in.
- `weightless_call` is for a rule that reads nothing -- `NoShort` is the shipped example -- and
  deliberately has no window at all. A test that hands it to a rule which does read gets an
  `AssertionError` naming `read`, which is the honest failure: the test declared the rule reads
  nothing and the rule disagreed.
