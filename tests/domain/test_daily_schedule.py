"""Building an schedule from the sessions a dataset actually has.

The constructor takes events that are already known. The common case is not a list: it is
"every trading day the execution table has, at 08:00 local" -- `expand` with `1d`.
Turning one into the other is mechanical, and it was being written by hand at every call site --
three copies of the same sixteen lines, each of which owned the event id scheme and the DST
constants.

What those copies got to decide is what these tests pin down.
