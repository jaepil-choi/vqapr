"""AC-13 of the two-clocks campaign: the wiring table is the architecture, and it is closed.

Design §4: a role is one row -- which clock it is called on, what it is handed, who receives its
answer -- and the two things that differ between roles are decided there and nowhere else. §4.3:
a part declares its own clock, a tool attaches to another's. What is pinned here is that adding a
role means adding a row, that every authored class points at the row it implements, and that the
loop calls the market-clock roles in the order the table says.
