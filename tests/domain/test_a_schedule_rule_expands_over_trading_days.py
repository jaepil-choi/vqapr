"""`every` / `from` / `to` / `at`: the schedule clock as arithmetic over trading days.

Design §3.3-3.4 (record `204`). The declaration is a trading-day filter plus a within-day rule;
the trading days are handed in from data, and `ScheduleRule`/`Schedule.expand` do only
arithmetic on top -- so nothing here guesses a market fact. `UC-TIME-002`'s guarantee lives in
the first test: a 1-minute table and a daily table carry the same DAYS, so they expand to the
