"""Both members of the lookback pair are reachable from the scaffold, and both run.

`docs/issues/archive/033`. `RowsLookback` and `CalendarLookback` are a deliberate pair -- one indexed by
rows per name, one by calendar time -- and only the first was reachable by following the package:

* `RowsLookback` had no docstring, `CalendarLookback` documented only `lower_bound`;
* `vqapr new datamodel --lookback N` emitted `RowsLookback` unconditionally, with no flag for the
  other;
* the skill named neither class.

The cost is not aesthetic. A rows lookback returns each instrument's own last N observations, so on
an unbalanced panel the batch's calendar span is set by the sparsest name: a real materialization
asked for 313 rows over 1,637 names and got rows spanning **1,865 distinct sessions**, back to 2016.
Consumed the scaffold's way -- accumulate per name, take the last N -- a 2024 correlation matrix
then mixes a liquid name's 2023-24 returns with a delisted name's 2016-19 returns. It is
well-formed, non-null, passes every check, and is wrong.
