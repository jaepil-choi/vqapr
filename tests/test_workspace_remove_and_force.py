"""Re-registering in place and `remove`: the repair path a refusal used to name and forbid.

Editing a registered component and re-running produced two refusals that pointed at each other.
`loading.py` said *re-register the component*; `register_component` then refused exactly that and
demanded a new `component_id`. A reader following either arrived at the other, which
`docs/implementations/057` names as worse than a generic error.

These pin the way out and the guard that keeps it from becoming a way to break a workspace.

What can still name a component is a run (record `148`): the strategy binding that used to be a
registered `strategy_config` is derived by preflight from the run's own sessions and wall time,
so a run is the one live declaration a removal has to look for.
