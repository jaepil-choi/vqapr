"""Static + runtime refusal-code inventory over `src/vqapr`, bucketed by `Status`.

The baseline this module writes is the oracle `test_refusal_codes.py` diffs the source against:
which refusal codes the package declares, and under which `Status` each one is raised. Record
`171` slimmed it to exactly that -- **sets of codes per status, no file and no line per code** --
because the earlier per-call-site shape fired on every docstring edit above a raise site and was
regenerated past rather than read.

Two independent passes, on purpose:

- **Static (AST) pass** walks every `.py` file under `src/vqapr` and resolves, for every
  `Failure(...)` / `Failure.bounded(...)` construction, the `code` argument and the `status=`
  keyword. Codes are sometimes composed as an f-string over a module constant
  (`f"{SUBJECT}.key_missing"`), sometimes forwarded through a local helper (`workspace.
  _workspace_error`, `loading._failure`), so a plain text/regex scan for string literals would
  miss part of the vocabulary. This pass constant-folds those f-strings and follows parameter
  forwarding across call sites instead of guessing, for `code` and `status` alike -- across the
  whole package, because a refusal helper and its callers need not share a file
  (`run/engine/stages/compute.py` raises through `run/engine/output.py`'s `refusal`), and an
  index that stopped at the file boundary silently dropped a code whenever a module was split.
  A `status` that is a `Status` member (the case at almost every site) buckets the code
  under that member's number; a `status` computed from an exception (`status_of(error)`, a
  variable holding one) buckets it under `by_cause`, because the number is decided at runtime by
  whose frame raised.
- **Runtime pass** exercises refusal paths directly and records the `Failure.code` values a real
  `VqaprError`/`Diagnosis` actually produces. It is expected, and required, to reach *fewer* codes
  than the static pass -- no test suite exhaustively drives every declared refusal, and the gap
  between "declared in source" and "observed under test" is exactly what this baseline exists to
  make visible rather than hide.

Neither pass may guess: a `code` expression that cannot be resolved to one or more concrete
string values through constant folding and call-site tracing is recorded as *unresolved* --
file, line, and the raw unparsed expression -- never as a partial or wildcard code.
Where a parameter genuinely has more than one possible value across its call sites, every distinct
resolved code is recorded -- that is enumeration of real reachable values, not a guess.

One shape is neither declared nor unresolved: a **re-render**. `InputError.as_failure` builds a
`Failure(code=self.code, ...)` from a refusal it already holds, and `SimulationFailure` builds one
whose code a same-file helper renders from the `SimulationStage` the object carries
(`strategy.callback.intent`, ...). Those sites do not declare a code the folder could name; the
first was declared where the refusal was first raised and the static pass saw it there, and the
second is the closed `SimulationStage` set the skill documents as `strategy.<stage>`. They are
skipped, and `_is_rerender` says exactly which shapes count. The `strategy.*` family is therefore
absent from `static` by construction, not by omission.

class _SourceIndex:
    """Everything needed to resolve names and forwarded parameters across a set of modules.

    Built once over *every* module under `src/vqapr`, then reused for every `Failure` construction
    found in any of them. `parents` and `enclosing_function` let the resolver ask "which function
    scope owns this expression" without re-walking the tree for every query; `functions_by_name`
    and `calls_by_target` let it answer "who calls this function, and with what argument for this
    parameter" — the two questions a forwarded `code`/`stage` parameter needs answered before it
    can be folded into a literal.

    Those two are merged across modules on purpose. A per-file index only ever resolved a code
    forwarded through a helper defined in the same file, so splitting a module dropped codes from
    the inventory without any refusal changing: `run/engine/stages/compute.py` raises through the
    `refusal` helper `run/engine/output.py` defines, and `datamodel.compute_failed` vanished
    from the static pass the moment the two stopped sharing a file. A refusal helper is not
    required to live beside its callers, so neither is this index.

    Module-level constants are the one thing that must **not** merge. `NAME = "..."` is a per-file
    binding: two modules may legitimately bind the same name to different strings, and a name that
    is a module constant in one module is often an ordinary parameter in another. A merged mapping
    would fold a code to a stranger's value, or (via `_is_forwarded`) refuse to follow a parameter
    that was forwarding one — both worse than not resolving at all, because both are silent. They
    are kept per module and looked up through the module that owns the node being resolved.

    The trees are held for the index's lifetime because `parents` is keyed by `id(node)`: a
    collected tree could see its ids reused by a later one and cross-wire two files' scopes.
