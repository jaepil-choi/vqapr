"""`vqapr.account` carries measurements only, so a naive read of it cannot be wrong.

Issue 010. The table had two writers: a valuation event recording what the book was worth,
and a strategy callback recording the account it saw before deciding. The second wrote `nav=None`,
so a consumer reading a NAV series had to know to filter -- and one who forgot paired every real
value with a spurious null. That is the shape `implementations/056` measured as HML correlation
0.9726 -> 0.6877.

What must not be lost is the property 056 bought with its guard: a valuation clock sparser than the
decision clock leaves sessions its own events never reach, and on those the mark a callback
replays is the only record of the book's value there is. That case lives in
`test_valuation_clock.py`; this file pins the shape of the table itself.
