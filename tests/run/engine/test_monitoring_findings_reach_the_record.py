"""What compliance measured reaches the record, one row per rule per commit.

Before record `140` a monitoring event's findings lived on its trace and nowhere else. The
strategy record's `contract` block counted them (`held` / `checked`), so a run could say THAT a
limit was breached and never WHICH name, against WHAT bound, by HOW MUCH -- the three things PRD
7.1 says a breach must leave behind. `vqapr.monitoring` is where they go now, through the same
accept funnel every other package table uses, so a run with a store streams them to disk as it
goes.

Record `148` moved WHEN they arrive, and record `209` said who: the declared Compliance rules
observe the committed, marked book at every market-clock instant -- a fill's, or a held book's
valuation at its execution instant -- and the findings are dated by that instant.
The flow here holds on every session, so every session reaches the venue's 15:30 print, is
valued there, and is judged there.

Three properties, asserted directly:

- a run with a store writes one row per declared rule per commit, typed -- a `Decimal`
  reads back a `Decimal`, `passed` a bool, `offenders` the breaching ids joined by a space --
  stage `MONITORING`, `event_time` the fill instant, and keeps none of them on its roots;
- without a sink the rows sit on the roots, as every package table's do;
- a run that declared no rule writes no such table at all.
