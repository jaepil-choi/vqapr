"""The book is valued at the instant the venue fills, and the NAV row is written there.

Record `148` retired the independent valuation clock. A run used to declare a valuation schedule
of its own (AC-M7: value every session the venue printed, even when the strategy decided
monthly); now every strategy is asked on every session at the run's `at`, a `Hold` still
reaches the venue's execution instant, and the book is valued there from the prices it would
have filled at. There is no second clock to keep independent, because the one clock already
reaches every session.

What that clock guaranteed still has to hold, and this file guards it on its successor:

- a strategy that decides once and holds still leaves a NAV at **every** session, because each
  Hold is valued at its execution instant;
- the NAV row is written by the valuation path at the fill instant -- stage `VALUATION`,
  `event_time` the fill instant, `observed_at` the mark instant, one row per fill or held
  valuation -- and NAV moves with the price between decisions;
- the callback's own account row is a fallback for a mark nothing recorded, and a real run
  never needs it: every mark the venue's prices produce is recorded where it is taken.
