"""The point-in-time boundary is asserted, not assumed.

`derived_available_at` used to search its accesses for an instant later than `evaluation_time` and
stamp with that instead. The branch was unreachable, because every observation query binds
`WHERE available_at <= evaluation_time` (`scan.py:579,620`).

Deleting unreachable code is normally right. Here it would have removed the only thing watching for
a specific failure that nothing else in the stack can see: **look-ahead improves correlations.** A
run that reads tomorrow's price produces better numbers, not worse ones, so the count gate passes,
`compare_factors.py` passes, and every downstream figure looks like an improvement. A silent
improvement is the hardest kind of wrong to notice.

So the branch became an assertion, and this is the mutation test that proves the assertion is live:
the guarded condition is constructed directly, and the failure must be raised rather than absorbed.
