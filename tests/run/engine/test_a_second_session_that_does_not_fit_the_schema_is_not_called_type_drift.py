"""`docs/issues/archive/079`. A datamodel returning `Decimal` died eight sessions in, and the refusal
said `type_drift`: "return the same scalar type for each field on every session". The type was
`Decimal` in every session. What moved was its scale -- pyarrow inferred `decimal128(28, 27)`
from one session's ratios and the next session's needed 28 -- and the one accurate sentence in
the envelope was pyarrow's own, wrapped under a diagnosis that contradicted it.

Owner ruling, 2026-09-05: the data and its types are the author's. The framework declares no
schema, casts nothing, and asserts no cause it did not measure.

Since `docs/issues/archive/088` a `Decimal` value field never reaches a second session: a dataset cannot
declare DECIMAL, so the producer refuses it at the first session as `datamodel.output.field_type`.
The scale drift that filed `079` is therefore unreachable, and `schema_mismatch` is pinned here
with a drift that is still possible -- an `int` on one session and a `str` on the next -- because
its promise is unchanged: pyarrow's own sentence, the schema the first session fixed, no cause.
