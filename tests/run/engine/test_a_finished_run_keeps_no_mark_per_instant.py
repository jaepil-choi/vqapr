"""Record `224`: what a run keeps in memory does not grow with the market clock.

A minute table values the book 390 times a day, and every valuation is a `Mark` per held name.
Until `224` each batch hung off the run's evidence and traces until the run ended -- instants x
names objects, which for 3,000 names over a year is more than the process can hold. The marks
are `vqapr.account` rows the moment they are made, so the evidence keeps a summary and the
batch is garbage as soon as the account's retained window lets it go.

Measured on the AC-1 workspace: eleven market-clock instants, one name, decisions every minute.
Before `224` a finished result kept one `Mark` per instant; now it keeps the account's retained
mark and nothing per instant.
