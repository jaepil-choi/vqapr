"""One run's refusal is that run's outcome, and a worker's refusal comes back.

`docs/issues/archive/073`: under `--jobs` a strategy's `SimulationFailure` could not be pickled
back to the parent (its keyword-only constructor and the `Rebalance` it kept on itself), so the
batch ended `stage: unhandled` with `failures: []` and named none of the strategies that had
finished. `docs/issues/archive/071`: the failure named no strategy and its `source` was three
nulls.

**The unit moved on 2026-09-09** (`docs/design/two-clocks-and-the-wiring-table.md` §2.3). A run
holds one model, so what used to be three strategies in one run is three runs, and the guarantee
this file pins moved with them: one refusal is reported as that RUN's outcome and the others
still run. The pickling rule is unchanged -- it is why the worker returns a `StrategyOutcome`.

Three runs of the shipped sample journey: the sample strategy twice, and a strategy that raises
from its own file between them.
