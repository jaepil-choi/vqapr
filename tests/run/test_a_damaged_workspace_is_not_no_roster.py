"""A damaged workspace is not "no roster", and the report describes the roster the run READ.

`docs/issues/archive/050`, the sibling of `docs/issues/archive/042` at the other door. 042 closed the guard around
the roster POINTER and its own closing text named what stayed open: *"only `Workspace.open` itself
is guarded."*

## Half one

`Workspace.open` decodes `.vqapr/workspace.yaml` and raises a typed `workspace.open.invalid` for a
file that is corrupt or half-written. Both readers on the run path wrapped it in `except Exception:
return None`, and `None` means **no roster is registered** -- a legal, ordinary state. So a
workspace damaged between preflight and `run()` made a project that HAS a roster read as one that
never had one: the run continued, every fill recorded `kind: None`, and on a KRX-shaped venue the
ETF sleeve was charged the share rate. That is `docs/issues/archive/007` returning through a `try/except`
written for an absent workspace.

## Half two

`roster_report`'s docstring claimed its answer came "from the roster already loaded for this run
rather than from a second read". That was true of `by_kind` and false of `digest` and `tables`,
which came from a second `registered_instruments()` -- the file as it stood minutes later. A
`vqapr register` landing mid-run made the frozen record carry the NEW roster's digest beside fills
classified by the OLD one, which is precisely the drift the `source_digest`/`declared_digest` pair
exists to expose.
