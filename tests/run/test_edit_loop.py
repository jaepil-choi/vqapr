"""The edit loop: change one line, re-run, get a result whose digest moved. Two commands.

Issue 009's stated acceptance criterion for removing the component-fingerprint refusals, written
as a test because the criterion is behavioural: *"change one line of a registered strategy, run,
and get a result with a new `source_digest` -- in TWO commands, with no new component id, no new
config binding and no spec edit."*

Before the change this was impossible in either direction. `loading.py` refused the edited source
with `component.load.fingerprint_drift` and named "re-register the component" as the repair;
`register_component` refused exactly that and demanded a new `component_id`. The refusals pointed
at each other, which `docs/implementations/057` names as worse than a generic error.
