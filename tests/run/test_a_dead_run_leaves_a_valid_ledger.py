"""AC-12 of the two-clocks campaign (design §5.1): a run that dies leaves a short ledger, not a
damaged account.

An append-only ledger has no half-written state: every prefix is a valid ledger. A strategy that
raises on its third decision has two fills behind it, streamed to the record as they were
committed, and what is on disk folds -- entry by entry, from the declared opening cash -- to
exactly the account the last mark valued. Nothing about the death is in the numbers; only the
story is shorter.
