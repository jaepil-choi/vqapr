"""A registered roster whose pointer is damaged is refused, not read as "no roster".

`docs/issues/archive/042`, found by the structural audit in
`docs/diagnostics/2026-08-31-vqapr-structural-refactoring.md` (C1).

`Workspace.registered_instruments()` raises a typed `workspace.instruments.unreadable` for a
damaged pointer, and says why in its own docstring: *"'no roster' and 'a roster whose record is
damaged' are different states, and only the first is ordinary."*

Two callers on the run path caught `Exception` around it and returned `None`. (Both lived in
`vqapr.public` as `_registered_roster` and `roster_report` until record `111` moved them to
`vqapr.run.roster` and made the first one public; the defect and its fix are unchanged.) `None` means **no
roster registered** -- a legal, ordinary state -- so a truncated `.vqapr/instruments.json` made a
run complete with `ok: true`, `roster: null`, and every fill recording `kind: None`. On a KRX-shaped
venue that charges the ETF sleeve at the share rate, which is exactly the defect `docs/issues/archive/007`
closed, returning silently through a `try/except` written for a different case.

The comment three lines below the swallow said *"A REGISTERED roster that cannot be read is refused,
not degraded."* It was true of the roster TABLES and false of the pointer that names them.
