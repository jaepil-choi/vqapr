"""Record `257`: a `--jobs` worker starts with one BLAS thread unless the user chose otherwise.

numpy's OpenBLAS commits a working buffer per core it may use when it loads -- about 0.8 GB of
private memory on the 32-core machine the 2026-09-11 memory report was measured on, of which
27 MB was ever touched. Every worker of a batch is its own process and made its own. The owner
chose (2026-09-11) to start batch workers single-threaded: N workers already use the cores, and
N x 32 BLAS threads only fight over them. A value the user set is theirs and is left alone, and
the parent's environment is what it was once the batch returns.
