"""A real run freezes real records, and a second run of one strategy refuses by name.

This path once shipped with no coverage at all. `public.run(store_root=...)` was never called from
any test, showcase or script, so `replace=`, `RunRecordExists`, the CLI's `--force` handler and
the record's drift guard were all live and unexercised.

The run here is the shipped sample journey, because a record is only worth freezing if a real run
produced it: a hand-built `SimulationResult` would exercise the writer while proving nothing about
what a run actually records. Two records since `139`: `run.json` and one `strategy.json`.
