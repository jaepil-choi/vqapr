"""A run's recorded table is a parquet directory, and it registers as a dataset as-is.

One-shape campaign Step 4 (`docs/refactoring/2026-09-04-the-one-shape-campaign.md` §1.4). The
publication machinery in `flow/materialize.py` existed to hand one strategy's output to another
strategy as a dataset. Record `146` made a run's tables parquet, and this is the third path that
made the first two redundant: register the directory. Pinned here so the path stays open after the
publishing one is gone -- the four ensemble showcases stand on it.

Two things the registration must say, because a record does not: `available_at` is `event_time`
(the decision instant the row was written at), and a `Decimal` is stored as text, so a numeric
field is `CAST`. It is cast to `DOUBLE`, the one numeric type a dataset field may declare
(`docs/issues/archive/088`): the record keeps the member's `Decimal` exactly, and the dataset the next run
reads is the data plane, which is float.
