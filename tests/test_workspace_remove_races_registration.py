"""`Workspace.remove()` checked its references outside the lock it then took.

`docs/issues/archive/043`. The sequence was:

    blockers = self.references_to(kind, identity)   # its own _read(), no lock
    if blockers:
        raise ...
    with self._exclusive():                        # the lock starts HERE
        state = self._read()
        ...

Two reads, no lock across them. A second process that registers a declaration naming the target in
that window loses: the removal proceeds on a reference list that was already stale.

**The result is worse than a lost update.** The document reader validates forward references, so a
document holding a run that names a component nobody registered does not merely carry a dangling
pointer -- `Workspace.open()` **raises**, and every command in the project fails until the file is
hand-repaired. Two ordinary concurrent commands produce a workspace no command can open.

The interleaving here is forced rather than hoped for. `_exclusive` is wrapped so the competing
registration runs and commits at the moment the remover is about to take the lock -- after the
pre-check in the old code, before the lock in both. The competing writer takes the lock properly, so
this is a race between two well-behaved callers, not a test that cheats by writing behind the lock's
back.

The competing declaration is a run (record `148`): the per-strategy binding that used to be
registered is derived from the run now, so a run is what names a component.
