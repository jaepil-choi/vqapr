"""The retired sections of `workspace.yaml` are read and dropped, never refused.

Record `144` (deletion campaign Step 3) retired `valuation_configs` and `monitoring_policies`:
each restated an schedule's own `role` under a second key. Record `148` retired `agendas` and
`strategy_configs` with them: a run declares its sessions and the one wall time `at` itself, every
strategy is called on every session, and the schedule preflight runs on is derived from the run. Four
sections, one rule, asserted here:

- a `workspace.yaml` written by 0.3.0 still opens, and the next write that changes the document
  drops all four -- what they said is either restated by the run or was never information;
- a user's declaration document that still carries any of them is refused by name, the way any
  unknown section is, so the author learns what to delete rather than what to add;
- a 0.3.0 `runs:` entry, which named agendas instead of declaring its clock, is refused at open
  naming the run, because a run without `timezone`, `at` and sessions cannot be executed;
- `register_run` is the public registrar and the retired registrars and types are gone from the
  surface.
