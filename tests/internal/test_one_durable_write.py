"""An interrupted write leaves the target exactly as it was, at all four former call sites.

Four implementations of "stage beside the target, fsync, `os.replace`" existed, and they had each
independently decided what to do about the parts that are easy to forget. Only `workspace.py`
retried the swap, and the reasoning for it -- `os.replace` onto a path a reader holds open fails
with `WinError 5` on Windows, readers take no lock deliberately, measured at 1 run in 10 with eight
concurrent processes -- is about `os.replace`, not about workspaces. The other three were exposed to
a race the fourth had already measured and solved.

Only two of the four fsynced; `run_records.finish` did not, on the package's crash-safety-critical
path, with nothing documenting that as a choice.

What each caller keeps is what was never about durability: its own failure vocabulary
(`on_error`), a content-addressed store's verification hook (`verify`), and whether the parent
directory's absence is a signal (`create_parent`).
