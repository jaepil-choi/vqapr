"""The workspace holds its directory with the shared mutex, and reports its own refusal.

**This file used to be `test_one_mutex_two_callers.py`**, and it pinned the two exclusive-lock
sites — `workspace.py` and `catalog_store.py` — against each other after they had drifted apart.
Record `124` deleted the catalog with the rest of the unshipped Project cluster, so there is one
caller now and the divergence this guarded against cannot recur. What survives is the property
that outlived the comparison: `filelock` clamps a future mtime, treats a vanished lock as no age,
reclaims a stale one, and lets its caller name the refusal.

Out of scope on purpose: `flow/run_records.py`'s lock. It is a run-length **lease**, not a mutex —
`heartbeat` and `release` never raise by design, and staleness is what makes a dead run's id
reclaimable. `run_records.py` records two prior attempts to simplify around it that each made a real
race measurably worse (9 of 12, then 12 of 12 failures) and were reverted. The exclusive-lock count
in this package is **one**, and record `106` said `two` when the catalog still existed.
