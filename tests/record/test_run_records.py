"""Run records survive the process that wrote them, and five writers do not lose each other.

`recorder_rows` is in-memory only, which makes two things impossible rather than merely awkward:
five parallel runs cannot each be read afterwards, and a finished run cannot be asked anything
without being run again. Freezing the record to disk is the prerequisite for both, so the tests
that matter here are the ones a single-process implementation would pass by accident:

- five INDEPENDENT processes writing at once, each leaving an intact record;
- a COLD process, which never saw any of them, reading all five.

`multiprocessing.spawn` rather than `fork`: this workstation is Windows, where `fork` does not
exist, and the plan's original bash `&` does not transfer either.
