"""What an `ObservationBatch` holds, pinned as a promise rather than left to be measured.

`docs/issues/031`. `ModelWindow.observations(requirement)` is the only method a DataModel author
can call to see any data at all, and its return type was:

* not importable -- `hasattr(vqapr.public, "ObservationBatch")` was `False`;
* undocumented -- no docstring on the class or on `observations`;
* unmentioned by the skill, along with `.rows`.

So three questions an author must answer before writing a single line had no answer on the public
surface: does a row carry its own `available_at`, are rows ordered by time, and are they grouped by
instrument or interleaved. The reporting journey answered them by registering a throwaway DataModel
whose `compute` printed `sorted(rows[0].keys())` -- a full register-materialize-show cycle spent on
one type's field names -- and then noted the residual risk in their own words: the ordering was
confirmed on one window of three names at one instant, **and every residual in the run depended on
it**.

The docstring now states the guarantee. This is what makes it a guarantee: `scan.observation_rows`
pushes `ORDER BY available_at, <key fields>` into SQL for both lookback shapes, and a change that
drops it fails here rather than in someone's factor.
