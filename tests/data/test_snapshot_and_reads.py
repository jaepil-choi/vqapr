"""Reading a dataset, and reading one moment of it.

Two capabilities the framework had but did not hand over.

`Workspace.instruments()` / `.evaluation_times()` — the ability existed in `data/scan.py` and was
absent from the public surface, so the first external user resolved dataset -> source -> path and
opened parquet directly, in seven files. That binds user code to a storage decision the framework
declares is not part of its contract.

`ModelWindow.snapshot()` — a lookback returns a window, not a line. Even `RowsLookback(1)` returns
each instrument's own most recent row, and those rows do not share a date. Reading that window as
if it were one moment mixes dates silently, which is how a benchmark once summed above 1.0.
