"""AC-11 of the two-clocks campaign (design §6.1): a venue's settings are the venue's own.

One KRX venue file, registered twice -- once as KRX charges, once with the sale tax switched off
through `config:` -- and one run declaration pointed at each. The two runs fill the same rotation
on the same prices, charge differently, carry different identities, put their allocations in the
warehouse under different names, and each records what its venue declared it modelled.
