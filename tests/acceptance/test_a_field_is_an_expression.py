"""The acceptance criteria of `docs/issues/archive/049`'s ruling, read one at a time.

The campaign's own measurement is 614x on a Korean statement warehouse
(`kwam-enhanced-index/vqapr-performance-testbed/`), which this suite cannot carry. What it can
carry is the property that measurement depends on and that a fast wrong answer would break: **the
same facts registered long, with the reduction written as field expressions, deliver exactly what
the pre-pivoted registration delivers.** A materialization that is 600x faster and slightly
different is a different model rather than a faster one, so the equality is checked as a full
anti-join in both directions rather than as a spot comparison.

The other two criteria are the ruling's other halves: a dataset with no instrument axis is not
narrowed by a run's instrument list (`docs/issues/archive/038`), and a requirement is a field id and a
lookback and nothing else.

    long source carries several rows per instant and a `RowsLookback` counts instants.

    `SPARSE` is built so the two ways of counting disagree about it. It publishes on five instants
    inside the bound window, two account rows on each: the values the projection produces number
    5, short of the declared 8, so it is unsafe and must be read unbounded; the source's rows
    number 10, which would prove it safe and lose the older instants the window was declared to
    include.

    **On this fixture the wrong count is loud, and that is not a safety net.** Every field here is
    an aggregate, so counting the source through them is `count(sum(...))` -- a nested aggregate
    duckdb refuses to bind. Checked by making `_counted` return the row-wise vocabulary for a
    grouped registration: this test then fails with `Binder Error: aggregate function calls cannot
    be nested`, before any answer is produced.

    **Do not read that as the binder guarding it.** A grouped registration may expose a field that
    is a bare grouping key -- `fields: {stamp: <the available_at column>, total: sum(x)}` binds
    grouped, because the key is grouped by -- and `count(<that column>)` binds perfectly well over
    the source while counting something else entirely. The guard is `_Counted`, which gives the
    statement and the sidecar one vocabulary structurally; the binder merely happens to catch the
    all-aggregate case first.
