"""The signal-measurement showcase's own pipeline, run headlessly and checked.

This does not reimplement `showcases/show_007_signal_measurement/run.py`'s pipeline: it imports the
showcase module directly and calls its `_pipeline` function against a pytest-owned temporary
project, exactly as `run.py`'s own `main()` does against `outputs/`. Reimplementing the pipeline
here would let a regression in the showcase's own code leave this suite green, which would prove
nothing about the code that actually ships.

Three things are asserted beyond what `run.py` itself already asserts before returning:

* the recorded tables exist with the shape the assignment requires,
* the neutralised signal is exactly orthogonal to a market column on every event, recomputed
  from the published artifact rather than trusted from the transform, and
* the re-hydrated marks equal the committed ones, field for field.
