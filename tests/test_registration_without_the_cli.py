"""A declaration document registers without `vqapr.cli` being imported at all.

This is the audit's own stated criterion for Step 8, and it is the assertion that proves the move
rather than describing it: **can the same conclusion be reached without importing `vqapr.cli`?**

`cli/register.py` was 1,093 lines. It read the YAML, validated key sets, resolved relative paths,
parsed agendas and sessions, walked a `.py` with `ast` to find the sole authored subclass, and
registered the result. `docs/vqapr-architecture.md` §10.2 defines the CLI as a product surface
rather than a layer, and a surface that owns rules costs twice: the rules cannot be tested without
driving argparse, and they cannot be reached from another entry point — so a second entry point
grows its own copy and the two diverge.

`docs/issues/archive/012` is that divergence, already paid for: `check` refused a spec that `run` completed,
because each verb decided for itself.
