"""Parallel registration does not lose declarations.

Running strategies in parallel is the normal case for a loop-based engine, not an edge one. The
workspace write was already atomic -- a temporary file replaced into place -- but atomicity only
guarantees a reader never sees half a file. It does not stop two processes from each reading the
same state, each adding one declaration, and the second write erasing the first.

Nothing fails when that happens. A declaration is simply gone, and the run that needed it reports
a missing reference somewhere unrelated.

These tests use real processes. Threads would share an interpreter and could pass while the
cross-process case still lost writes.

The declaration each writer adds is a component: since record `148` an schedule is derived from
the run rather than registered, so a component is the smallest declaration a process registers.
