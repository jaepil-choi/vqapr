"""What the workspace writes, it reads back and writes again byte-for-byte.

Deletion campaign Step 4 (record `145`) moves the workspace document onto pydantic models one
section at a time. The property that must hold at every step is the round trip: a document the
current tree wrote opens, and writing the same state again produces the same bytes. A model that
reordered keys, dropped a default or re-spelled a value would show up here as a diff, printed in
full so the reader sees exactly which section moved.

The fixture is built through the public API rather than pasted, so it is always the shape the
tree writes today; the on-disk shape is pinned separately by `tests/test_workspace.py`.
