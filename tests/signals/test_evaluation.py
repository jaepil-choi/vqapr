"""Signal statistics, anchored on identities the data itself fixes.

The anchors here are exact and derived from the values rather than from a number this milestone
also wrote. A signal correlated with itself must be one; negating the signal must flip the sign; a
perfect-foresight signal built from the outcome must score strongly positive rather than negative.
A sign error cannot survive any of them, which is what makes them anchors rather than restatements.
