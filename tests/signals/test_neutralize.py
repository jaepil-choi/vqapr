"""Neutralisation, checked by the property that kills a no-op.

The falsifier here is weighted orthogonality: the residual is orthogonal to every exposure column
under the weights. An identity transform fails it on the first column, so this is a real check
rather than a restatement of the arithmetic that produced the number.

Orthogonality is asserted by rebuilding rationals from the returned values, which carry twelve-place
quantisation, so the comparison is against that quantum rather than a bare zero. The solve itself is
exact; what rounds is the boundary crossing on the way out.
