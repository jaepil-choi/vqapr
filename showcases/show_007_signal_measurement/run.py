Every event that computes a signal records it — the value **before** weighting (the ranked
reversal view) and the value **after** neutralisation — on a declared recorder table. Nothing here
constructs that table by hand: the rows come from the real callback the Flow actually dispatched.

Two things get proved after the run, neither of them by construction:

* The recorded signal table and the package's own ``vqapr.account`` series are published with
  ``publish_run_record``, read back from the parquet the publication wrote (not from the run's own
  objects), and their row counts are checked against ``result.final_state.recorder_rows`` — the
  same round trip show_006 proves for an allocation, now proved for a diagnostic table.
* The account rows the publication produced are used to key into the run's own committed
  ``mark_history``; each ``Mark``/``MarkBatch`` is rebuilt from primitive ``Decimal(str(...))``
  values — the same string round trip every other table in this package stores decimals with — and
  the rebuilt value is asserted field-for-field equal to what the run actually committed. This is
  the seam the next milestone story's analysis functions depend on: a later reader has only rows,
  never the producing run's objects, and this is the proof that rows are enough.

The fill journal is replayed independently against the committed Account, and the whole pipeline
runs twice into separate projects so the reported outcome and the artifact digests can be compared.
