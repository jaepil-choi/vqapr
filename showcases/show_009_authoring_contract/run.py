"""show_009 — the same strategy, before and after the authoring contract.

Runs one cross-sectional momentum view twice on committed sample data: once returning a
hand-assembled portfolio the way a user had to before Step 7, and once returning
`Rebalance.of(long=...)`. Both produce the same book, which is the point -- the ceremony was never
carrying information, it was carrying the risk of getting arithmetic wrong.

Reproduce:

```
uv run python showcases/show_009_authoring_contract/run.py
