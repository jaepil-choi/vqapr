"""The authored StrategyModel for show_001, at real module scope.

The engine's loader resolves a registered component by re-importing its module and
looking the class up by name; a class defined inside `run.py`'s `main()` would have no
stable import location and would be refused. This module exists solely so
`ShowcaseStrategy` has one.

`decide()` returns only `Hold`/`Rebalance` - never a UUID, strategy id, source refs, or
account version. The framework stamps all of that identity; the author's only job is the
economic decision.

**It declares one dataset read, and the read is real.** A declaration nothing consumes would
be a lie, so the decision is conditioned on the close actually being there: no observed
price, no book. Whether the book was already issued lives in `self.memory`, which the
framework restores before every `decide()` and snapshots after it.
