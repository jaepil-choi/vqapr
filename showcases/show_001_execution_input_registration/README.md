# VQAPR venue dataset registration and simulation

Status: current

This showcase proves the shipped spine end to end: `vqapr.public` registrations plus one
authored `vqapr.public.StrategyModel` run a real simulation. The dataset, the execution
input and its fill convention, the strategy, the exchange, and the two agendas are each
registered explicitly, then frozen by `freeze` and executed by `run` — the same path
`vqapr register` and `vqapr run` take.

The strategy lives in `show001_models.py`, a real project-local module, because the engine's
loader resolves a component by re-importing its module and looking the class up by name; a
class defined inside `run.py`'s `main()` would have no stable import location and would be
refused. `ShowcaseStrategy` returns only `Hold`/`Rebalance` — the loader adapts the authoring
contract onto the engine's, and the framework stamps every identity fact (intent id, strategy
id, source refs, account version) itself.

It declares one dataset read and the read is real: the loader requires a registered
StrategyModel to declare at least one requirement, and a declaration nothing consumes would be
a lie told to satisfy a gate. No observed close, no book.

Evidence includes:

- one real run against a real `.parquet` execution table: pending intent → due execution →
  account advance;
- a density-invariance comparison across two runs of one registered declaration: the dense
  execution table carries three extra non-selected 10:00 rows the canonical trim does not,
  and the two runs' economic signatures — account version, cash, positions, lifecycle
  counts — are equal. The declaration is registered again over the rewritten file (record
  234: a run reads only the bytes registration measured, and registering the same
  declaration again re-measures them);
- the venue table registered as a dataset with an `execution` role (record 185), the fill
  declared on the run; and an invalid venue table (a non-finite close) refused by
  `register_dataset` like any other dataset, without any change to the project's persisted
  `.vqapr/workspace.yaml`.

## Dropped from the legacy showcase

The legacy showcase generated a project-local `Constraint` component whose `project`,
`validate_intended`, and `evaluate` methods were unconditionally-passing stubs projecting
trivial `[0, 1]` per-instrument bounds. It demonstrated no economic behaviour of its own —
only that such a component could be generated, fingerprinted, and registered. That
scaffolding claim is not worth keeping: the box kit and the compliance rules are exercised for
real in `show_003` and `show_008`, and authoring an inert one here just to keep a field
non-empty would demonstrate nothing. The run declares no `compliance` instead.

## Reproduce

From the repository root:

```powershell
uv run --no-sync python showcases/show_001_execution_input_registration/run.py
```

Inspect:

- `outputs/report.html` — reader-facing run and invariance evidence;
- `outputs/trace.json` — complete run summary and comparison signatures;
- `outputs/workspace.yaml` — persisted declarations (`.vqapr/workspace.yaml` from `PROJECT`);
- `outputs/*.parquet` — dense, canonical, and invalid venue-table fixtures;
- `show001_models.py` — the authored `StrategyModel`, at module scope so the engine's
  loader can resolve it;
- `show001_exchange.py` — the registered `AcademicExchange` the run fills against.

Environment assumptions: repository `uv` environment, Python 3.12+, DuckDB 1.5+.
