"""An alpha run, its published allocation, and an enhanced index built on top — through the spine.

    alpha run (Academic)  ->  its recorded vqapr.weight, registered  ->  alpha_allocation
                                                                |
    committed benchmark panel  ------------------------------- + -->  enhanced index run (KRX)
                                                                          desired = bench + s·active
                                                                          built inside no_short
                                                                          and single_name_cap

Both halves are ordinary runs: `RunDefinition`, `freeze`, `run`, a real `Account`, real order
planning and the declared execution profile. The enhanced-index Strategy reads **two allocation
inputs** — the committed benchmark and the published alpha — through ordinary `DataRequirement`
subscriptions inside its point-in-time window, so the combination is proved on the subscription
path rather than by reading parquet beside it. Its bounds are the ones the registered shipped
box the strategy builds for that event, not a second copy of the same rule.

The fill journal the second run committed is replayed independently against the committed
`Account`, the monitoring findings over every marked account version are read back rather than
assumed, and the whole pipeline runs twice into separate projects so the artifact digests can be
compared.

Everything is real KRX data committed under `tests/fixtures/real`. Nothing here invents a price or
an index weight.

    the index moves: the book is built at 09:00 against the previous session's weight and marked at
    16:30 against the current one, so a position sized exactly to yesterday's ceiling sits above
    today's. That is a property of benchmark-relative caps between rebalances, and it is reported
    rather than smoothed away.

    `no_short` is different. It has no moving reference, and a marked short position in a long-only
    account would mean the account authority itself failed, so that one aborts.
