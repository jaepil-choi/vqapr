This is show_006's two-member shape carried to three, which is the point: `UC-ENSEMBLE-001` is
stated for "여러 stored alpha-weight result", and two members cannot distinguish a helper that
generalises from one that happens to work in pairs. With three, `offset_weight = min(long, |short|)`
is no longer a restatement of "the two disagreed" — a name can be long in two members and short in
one, and the offset has to report what actually cancelled.

**The low-volatility member is the reason this showcase exists rather than an edit to show_006.**
It is the first alpha in the tree whose signal is a rolling time-series statistic. The member
computes the statistic directly with the standard library, while the pipeline measures the
published signal against the return that followed it with `information_coefficient`.

Canon decides where the alphas live. PRD §2.7 says vqapr may ship reference components but does not
lock project-owned proprietary alpha into package built-ins, and the module map gives StrategyModel
built-ins as **없음** for exactly that reason. So all three members are written as project-local
component files, like show_006's, and nothing in `src/vqapr/` learns what a low-volatility alpha is.
What the package supplies is the non-trivial portfolio and analysis surface: `equal_weight`,
`rescale`, `net_members`, and `information_coefficient`.

The fill journal the ensemble committed is replayed independently against the committed `Account`,
and the whole pipeline runs twice into separate projects so the artifact digests can be compared.

Everything here is real KRX data committed under `tests/fixtures/real`. Nothing here invents a
price or a signal.
