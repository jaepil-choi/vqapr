All three runs are ordinary runs: `RunDefinition`, `freeze`, `run`, a real `Account`, real
order planning and the declared execution profile. `reversal` mutates `self.memory` every
event, exactly as show_005's alpha does; `momentum` never assigns `self.memory` at all, so its
published lineage carries `state_path == ["constant"]` while `reversal`'s carries `["moved"]` — the
package-computed, unforgeable proof that one callback body actually moved state and the other did
not.

The ensemble reads **two allocation inputs** — the published `reversal_allocation` and
`momentum_allocation` datasets — through ordinary `DataRequirement` subscriptions inside its
point-in-time window. It measures what combining them implies with `net_members` (ticker-level
long side, short side, the offset that cancelled, and what survived), combines the members by
`equal_weight` and matches its own gross-active budget with `rescale`. Long-only is never asked of
either member: it emerges only from the `no_short` and `single_name_cap` box the
ensemble runs under on the KRX profile.

The fill journal the ensemble run committed is replayed independently against the committed
`Account`, and the whole pipeline runs twice into separate projects so the artifact digests can be
compared.

Everything here is real KRX data committed under `tests/fixtures/real`. Nothing here invents a
price or a signal.
